1, The NICEST security staff and by far the absolute FASTEST baggage claim staff to be found anywhere! Your bags are making the rounds before you even make it down to them. Always such a pleasure to come home.,Before
2," Its a LOOOng strip of stores and yummy food places which include Amy's ice cream that I did not have time to try downtown so I did at the airport and they were so so good. There even is a life band which is just too cool for school. If you get stuck there, you will be fine.",Before
3," This is reguarding the parking only!! This is the only thing I hope gets changed in the future. I have flown out 5 times this month on different days and times. Each time has been a parking nightmare! For some reason each time I have been there all lots have been full and I have had to park in the cargo lot. Ok, if in fact that the lots were actually full. I arrived for my flight on Wednesday afternoon 4 hours early and yes cargo lot again. I took that extra time to quick walk through the garage and wow just on the first level there were 100 spots open, I just didnt count anymore after all the other levels. When I asked about why, the ABIA official said that the last walkthrough said nothing was open and that was 4 hours prior. I know they have built a new parking garage, but found out that is for rental cars. I really hope they get this parking thing sorted out. Until then I guess I will UBER.",Before
4," This is a good airport. Its laid out in such a way that it's easy to get around. The rental car facility is on site with no bus ride like at DFW. Traffic gets a little dicey on 71 going in and out of the airport. But it's usually not too bad. I'm surprised that even this airport doesn't have a Whataburger. Folks, this is Texas...",Before
5," The WhyIf you can help it, don't make the mistake of departing on a late flight, or arrive too early. The businesses in Bergstrom seem to run on bankers hours. Save for a gross misrepresentation of Salt Lick BBQ in the form of a ""Taco Stand"" there isn't much open after 8:00pm. If you can't help your arrival/departure times, grab a bite to eat before you get to ABIA. There are no vending machines!The GoodThere are a nice collection of automated retailers that sell makeup, electronics. The restrooms are always clean.The terminals are laid out in a semi-circle horseshoe pattern and they do a good job logistically of reducing the usage of the entire terminal after hours.",Before
6, I have to say I really like AUS airport. It is big enough but also small enough to not have to break your leg if you have to run and catch a flight. I LOVE that there is a Salt Lick in here so I can get my fix before I go home! I also like the short and sweet designated TSA line. Not too shabby - and it literally took me less than,Before
7," I love that for the most part ABIA keeps it local when it comes to restaurants, bars, shops and live music. But without doubt ABIA could use some improvements.ABIA is one of the few airports I enjoy enough to arrive early. As you walk by the carousels there are gorgeous Austin themed guitars welcoming you. You can catch live music at many of the bars and restaurants. As soon as you make your way up the elevator you can hear music coming from Ray Bensons place. The gift shops carry many novelty items and t-shirts with sayings like ""Have a Willie Nice Day"" and ""Keep Austin Weird"". Although it is not local I do like to enjoy a glass of wine at Vino Volo which carries Austin Winery wines.The cell phone lot is a new improvement. If you are picking someone up from the airport you have a place to chill in your car versus driving in circles.What can be approved upon:- Restaurants opening early and staying open late. Come on this is an international airport. - The free WiFi should not be limited to 30 minutes (or is it an hour?).- Parking. During the summer months they often have people park in the overflow parking with no stall numbers etc. It doesn't seem that ABIA can meet the demands of its customers when it comes to parking.Overall I love our city's airports and all its quirkiness that makes Austin what it is.",Before
8," For a smaller airport this was pretty great, definitely a fan, lots of food to have, they have a United Club which is great also.  That's always a big plus for me.  It's not extravagant with a bunch of shopping but good food, and all of your basic necessities, and easy to get around.",Before
9," Very clean and efficiency is outstanding. Staff was polite from TSA, airline and food court. No complaints.",Before
10," ABIA, I was skeptical when you came along. I liked the old airport - it was so cozy and convenient and austiny. I liked the way things were. I didn't want to grow up - I still don't. But I have to admit that you've turned out to be just fine and I really appreciate the local representation in your food and music offerings. Dare I say you're pretty cool for a big city airport. But.For.the.love.of.GAWD.and….austin...Would you PLEASE give the people free wifi? Not from boingo, and not free for half an hour. I'm talking 24/7 free. We embraced you, now return the favor and be cool and bust out the free wifi. MAKE US PROUD.Love,Veek",Before
16," Short and Sweet. This airport is quick and convenient. Might be the easiest airport to get in and out of that I have ever been to. Short lines everywhere, only downside is, shops and restaurants/bars close super early!!  They need more amenities! But, if you want to travel and do it in an efficient manner, this is a great spot!",Before
17," Parking stinks. Close in parking full, picking up handicapped person. Person at pay area said take a shuttle and i said even for handicapped definitely poor answer. Use satellite parking they will at least take you to your car!",Before
18," Apparently I've never hit the Southwest counter when there's a delay. So, much of this downgrade is Southwest-counter-specific and AUS is still as good as it gets, but it pains me to say it's not the trouble-free experience it usually is if there's ANY issues anywhere at all. The big problem? Southwest has one line. One. Single. Line. That line moves along at an okay pace as herds of families and groups move on all as one, but why is there no baggage only line? Yo, I have my ticket printed. Lemme through to just drop this bag. Baltimore's Southwest counter pulls this, too, so it's not an Austin-specific problem, but since Austin's row of Southwest counters is that much shorter, the line doesn't move quite as fast. Seriously, dudes--please add a baggage-only line! Some of us don't need full service. Back-ups in our humble little airport are baaaaad. I got stuck in the delay aftermath of the mid-Atlantic states getting pounded with storms, and oof! People everywhere. Long lines everywhere. Fortunately, the TSA is pretty good about plucking people over to the priority line when they can to alleviate that line as well and give folks who may have trouble standing for longer periods of time (elderly travelers, usually) a break. Luckily, the Amy's counter had a short line and moved me through fast, so I at least got to wait it out with Shiner ice cream with delicious dark chocolate chunks on top. That's part of why I like our airport so much (woo Amy's!), but I can't wait for it to finally expand!",Before
19," Having dealt with other airports, I must say--I really like our airport. The TSA is annoying security theater, bound to make you feel like a terrorist for forgetting to take out a simple set of nail clippers or for bringing aboard one more ounce of sunscreen in a single container. Excuse me, if you're going to try taking over a plane with a set of nose hair trimmers, you're probably going to get kicked in the balls before you get anywhere with that. Security theater, however, is a universal complaint with all the airports in the country, though. I have never been hassled by our TSA dudes or lost anything in line, but then again, I'm a relatively harmless looking white woman. YMMV, and I hate that it's a fact that I have to type out that caveat. That being said, they've always been pretty friendly to me. The line moves extraordinarily fast compared to many other airports in the country and it's never a huge hassle to get through. Once you're past security, there isn't a lot you'll be missing on the outside. There are a lot of local eateries to peruse, including coffee that's far better than your usual airport Starbucks. Saxon Pub and Amy's are the real treats. On the other hand, Maudie's breakfast tacos weren't as good as their non-airport counterpart's, and Salt Lick's tacos are just as overrated as their restaurant. (I will inevitably give Maudie's breakfast tacos a second try, though, because they're breakfast tacos and they're there.)Best of all, everything is well-marked and easy to find. Yes, it's a smaller airport, which helps, but clear signage is key here. It's bright, clean and there's even slow, but functional free wifi now. Staff is friendly, baggage is easy to find on well-marked kiosks when you land, and it's not a perpetually wind-beaten location like DFW. (I hate flying. I hate turbulence. Not being in a ridiculously windy spot helps a lot with smooth landings and take-offs!)We're truly spoiled, and I think as far as airports go, AUS is as good as it gets.",Before
20," I think this airport is good because you can typically get to and through it in a relatively good amount of time. If you know how to work your way through the airport you can get here an hour before flight time even on a Monday morning and get through security and grab a few breakfast tacos and make it to your gate just in time to get your boarding group. Pickup and drop off here is relatively easy as well.  I've gone through SFO, ATL, LAX and O'Hare and AUS is amazing in comparison.",Before
21," Pretty nice airport.  Arriving and departing were relatively simple, though the lines looked daunting.  The name makes me think of Green Bay's airport- Austin Straubel- though the size, and climate outside, are very different.  Parking, security, check-in, bathrooms, charging points- all good not great.  It's clean, and there's a nice selection of food and shops.  We'll be back, and won't be too annoyed about it.",Before
22," Funniest part of this airport is that all the food seems to be fried or tex-mex. PLUS they have live music through out. Oh Texas, Who would have thunk it?",Before
23," Great airport with easy access in and out. Parking is expensive for short term but you can use Fast Park for a less expensive solution. ABIA is very modern with local eats from some of the city's famous locations. Don't miss the Salt Lick if you're visiting and want some great BBQ! Another one is Maudie's for Mexican food! (Breakfast tacos) To top it off for dessert, hit up Amy's ice cream! My favorite is the Mexican vanilla! Back to the airport... Ha! Have fun traveling through ABIA and keep Austin weird!!",Before
24," I can't believe they do not have free Wi-Fi at this airport. I do not rate an airport based on other people's products: i.e. restaurants, available goods and services etc.The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it is clean, easy to get around and good parking. But in this day and age I have never been to an airport (world traveler) that does not have free Wi-Fi.",Before
25," This airport was so awesome!I couldn't believe how stress-free it was, even in the afternoon.It was so quick, security was a breeze, and such an amazing staff. :)When I arrived from Los Angeles, back to Austin, the same kind of friendliness. :)Baggage claim was very quick too.The minute I got to the bottom of the stairs and to baggage claim, the bags were already coming down. Absolutely love it and I'll definitely be using this airport from now on.",Before
26," Things that make for a good airport in my book...clear signage, appropriate climate control, helpful staff. And the Austin airport has those. Plus by the minute massage centers and shopping and some exhibits from a vintage toy collection.The food choices were tough on me since they were all really meaty. But I really appreciated the massage spot since I was there a little early for my flight. Lots of southwest comfy chairs with charging stations. And the pretty much everyone I met was polite. So Yay for an easy experience.",Before
32," I didn't spend too much time at this airport since we were staying pretty close and my flight was on time (yay!) but a few observations. -- New signage. Looks like yellow poster board with black stickers on it to direct the overflowing customers around the airport. -- Maybe a little upgrade to the announcement speakers? Couldn't hear anything the Southwest Agent was saying regarding the flight. Just noticed when the flow of people were walking toward the gate. -- Why are there little gates by the baggage claim, WHO ARE THOSE GATES REALLY STOPPING??? It just makes it more difficult for anyone with actual luggage to leave the luggage area. Ok, rant over. Not a horrible airport but it could be better.",Before
33," Three Good Things About Austin's Airport:1. There were about seven people in front of us when we got to the security line. Predictably, we got through quickly. This is good.2. There was a live band at the gift shop. I don't think that airport gift shop is the most coveted gig in the city, but they were actually not bad.3. The Salt Lick. To be fair, we were actually BBQ'd out* at this point and we didn't go for it, but I take comfort knowing there is smoked meat nearby.____________*By 'we were BBQ'd out' I mean 'my wife was BBQ'd out and I always do everything she tells me to do.'",Before
34, Great airport but the TSA security needs to step it up. Way too many people flying in and out of here and TSA is staffing this place like it's a backwater po dunk town. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get through security.,Before
35, This airport is speedy for the most part with their security check points and they have the most polite and friendly TSA officers. I can also vouch for their long term parking...easy to figure out and shuttles pick up every 2 minutes! The austin airport has yet to disappoint me.,Before
36," Very straightforward airport with easy access from one gate to another.  Plenty of food options, including the great BBQ joint Salt Lick.  All of the good food options are post-security.  A few of the places had live music which was nice during a layover.  There's also an AA Admiral's club and United club within the terminal.",Before
37," Ive flown out of ATX a few times and flown into ATX a few times before I lived here. I enjoy that they have a few cool places to eat, i.e. The salt Lick and Amy's Ice Cream and lots of cool places to buy memorabilia. I enjoy also that they have the cell phone parking lot so you can chill till your party notifies you that they are ready for pick up. The cell phone lot has  the board notifying you of any delays, departure and arrival times etc. bathrooms. So very wait friendly. And you get signal service, hence the cell phone lot! No need to circle and circle and circle and what's that? oh yes, that's right...circle again. We flew out of here on our honeymoon to Italy. What sucked is they took forever in checking us in but never really explained what the hold up was?? But all was fine and we boarded our plane on time and even got to sit together which was not the case on the flights home. Oh and my luggage was on vacay in Europe a week longer than me with a 20 hour layover in Atlanta with no luggage! yay for sleeping in a hotel with no clothes to change into after showering! At least I felt like I was starring in my own hell version of planes, trains, and automobiles. or in this case planes, shuttles and Trams. Very nice guy let me know there was nothing I could do but call some number daily and check some Delta website. I finally called and explained because I carried on my bag *yes on my honeymoon* this suitcase had my medicine on it because I never expected to have to check. I carried my bag on al the way to Italy... er well till I switched planes from France to Italy. The above head bins on AirItalia are much smaller than Air France or KLM -or Delta for that matter. So they force you to check your bag. ergo... I was without my meds. A week later I got the call my bag was back stateside and ready to be delivered to me which could be prolonged or I could go pick it up myself. sounds easy enough? wrong = construction - parked car, waiting in line to reclaim my bag - took over an hour and a half. wow. If this happens to you, just let them deliver it.",Before
38," I love love love this airport! I don't know if I'm just partial to it because it's my hometown or because of the awesome vibe that I feel whenever I step foot in this airport. Honestly, this airport is on the smaller side especially now that Austin is getting super crowded. The good thing though, is that there is a good long stretch of road for both departures and arrivals so it's not as stressful when getting in and out. Another great thing I noticed is that this airport by far has the closest Cell Phone Lot to the terminal. Inside, you'll find a great many options for food and stuff to do. There are sculptures and paintings and a really great book store. The food, oh man, I really enjoy the fact that there are so many local staples to be found. Salt Lick BBQ and Amy's Ice Cream cannot be missed! Overall, it's not a bad place to hang around while waiting for a flight and I'm always excited to fly out to Austin.",Before
39," I don't love airports, but as far as airports go I am glad this is my home airport.  I travel all over the world and it's nice to come home to this one.Easy in and out.I wish it was relocated a bit more North like in Hutto.",Before
40," If you're hungry you have to go to Thundercloud Subs, they offer great tasting subs with real ingredients, local flavor and no hiked up airport prices! Its the same price there as it is in town!!",Before
41, Austin Airport is one of my favorite airports I like to pass thru or come to when I'm in TX. I usually get a rental car here and drive to other destinations within the state. Hanging out at the blues clues and catching good jazz bands whenever can.,Before
47," For a major airport their security lines are abysmal.  I understand they will be opening a new security checkpoint soon,  but in the mean time,  get there early!",Before
48," The Austin Airport is the gateway to Austin and Texas Hill Country and will be your arrival and departure point for your adventures. The airport is fairly close to downtown with good freeway access. Arriving baggage took longer than average even though it seemed like the overall distance was shorter. You must go upstairs to get your rental car on the top of the parking garage, but I recommend crossing at the baggage claim level if it is raining since there is a covered walkway missing on the top level.Departing was a breeze with easy rental car directions and quick security. The departure terminal was pretty nice with lots of good food and shopping options. I found a nice Southern place serving tasty fried chicken with real mashed potatoes and gravy. There was a lack of functional charging outlets in the gate area, and finding the restrooms took a while. Plus, where is a food truck? Seriously, put an airstream in the terminal and rake in the cash!I will return to Austin, and I will return to this airport. The location is just too convenient to pass up.",Before
49," Decent airport, though the checkin and security lines are awfully long for an airport of this size (at 6am), and they're behind the times and don't seem to have ANY fountains for filling your water bottle. Join the 21st century, folks!",Before
50," Not really a fan of this airport anymore.Too cramped and where is my Starbucks? I'm happy to support local and independents, but no Starbucks here? Not so bueno.Decent food selections here but all of the shops look the same selling the traveler crap.",Before
51," Nice, but already seems obselete due to the massive population growth in Austin.  Seems like they need to start expanding and now!Terminal is nice...airy and open.  Food options are great.  Fairly easy to get in an out.  Tip:  The 100 bus is a great alternative to renting a car in Austin.  Good schedule and it'll take you right downtown. Only $1 USD",Before
52," We flew out of Bergstrom to The Big Easy and because of bad weather at our stopover in Dallas, we spent a lot of time here and i may have visited half the food places and all the shops.  The one thing that I feel needs improvement is the signage to and from all the parking lots, we parked in lot A and a seasoned ABIA traveler led us to the terminal, we had the same problem finding lot A on our return, don't laugh...you'll get old too some day....and i was born geographically challenged.",Before
53," What is there not to love about the Austin Airport!? As a native Austinite, I love all the local businesses and the ease of just about every aspect this airport boasts. I believe that there are TSA pre-check points now at every location. Parking is only $7-8 daily in the long term lot and it is an easy walk to the terminal if the weather is nice. I spend a lot of time at the United Club and the staff there is all very friendly and helpful.",Before
54," Clean bathrooms, not too large. Minus one star bc NOTHING was open past 9pm. if you have a late flight, make sure to bring your snacks and drinks with you. They do have a salt lick bbq inside,  but we didn't get a chance to try as it was closed. So sad.",Before
55," Small airport for the size of city, I thought, though reasonably laid-out. On the air side the gates are all laid out in one long arc, so it's pretty simple to find what you're looking for.Except if what you're looking for are the airline lounges. They're all down at one end, though there are no signs until you're right there. You have two outlets for the excellent Salt Lick barbecue restaurant here, a great way to have a final taste before flying out.",Before
56, I travel a fair amount around the country and I find Austin's airport to be good but not one of the best. They do a great thing by only having local companies provide food services  and they have a bar area that even has live music.  The baggage wait time is one of the best in the country and the rental car is a non shuttle in airport which is awesome.  Once we can get some real direct international flights in and out this will be one of the best airports in the country,Before
57," Well, I left my 2013 pristine Kia Rio there in the Long Term parking C18 Space 50 and I thought Hmm right at the end of the row easy to find......Dumb...!Grass Clippings all over the side and a lovely paint scrape to match.I guess the weed whacker guy was having an off day",Before
63," This is a great airport! (*Please note that my place of departure is Chicago O'Hare, one of the most nightmarish airports in the country...) Its small size makes it manageable in many ways. TSA was the least stressful experience I had ever been through, and they tell you via television screen as you're in line how long the wait will be. (For me in early afternoon on a Monday it was 4 to 8 Minutes.)Despite the small size, this airport doesn't scrimp on amenities. Satellite locations of many local restaurants are represented, from Amy's Ice Cream to Salt Lick BBQ to Austin Java and more. There are assorted shops for souvenirs, and a location of Book People (somewhat less impressive than the 4-story store downtown, but it makes up for this in convenience, haha).There is also a surprising array of vending machines. Need some makeup on the fly? There's a Benefit machine! Are you just arriving and need some flowers to give the person you're meeting? Boquets available in another machine (I saw it being restocked). Did you just decide once you got past TSA that you need a Kindle? There's a Kindle Kiosk (you didn't really want to interact with some clerk while buying your new toy, did you?)You can even chill out before your flight with a chair massage ($15 for 10, and up.)To me the coolest thing was the live musicians playing throughout! There's a stage near the Salt Lick BBQ/Ray's Roadhouse food booths, and further down another musician was playing outside another eatery (I could hear him down at my gate too). :) They say that at any time of day or night you can hear live music somewhere in Austin, and that obviously includes the airport!I hope to come back to Austin soon, and when I do, I know I won't dread the airport. O'Hare (and others) can take a lesson!!",Before
64," This airport is small in size.  This makes it easy to find out where you are and where you want to go.The free WiFi has a cheesy login.  You are forced to answer a few questions like ""do you have a motorcycle"".  I think if you have a motorcycle, they will not let you on the internet, so always answer ""no"".",Before
65," I love this airport.. I know Austin is growing. so im assuming at some point it will have to expand. TSA agents are nice. its really only 1 terminal, no trains/shuttles to other areas. Austin is ""keep austin weird"" - so local places to eat. ( schlotzskys , salt lick, maudies, etc)    for the most part everyone seems like they really enjoy their jobs!( im not a seasoned traveler , i usually fly 2 - 3 times a year)",Before
66," Fly any airline except Frontier, you'll be good to go. Frontier has a skeleton crew at odd hours and they're intentionally unhelpful. Good food choices, short lines at security, and local Austin weirdness make a great super cute airport!",Before
67," The airport is nice, there is actually a lot of non-chains as far as your selection for food goes. The airport has a lot of the local food selections from around austin, which really makes its pretty nice for the people to are not familiar with austin. Its one of the cleaner airports ive been to also.",Before
68," Super easy, low-hassle airport. Lots of food options beyond security. Quick ride to downtown. I'm not sure what else you really want from an airport, people.",Before
69," By far the best airport you will ever go to.I travel a lot for work and I am so thankful to live in Austin. Fast security lines (I have pre-check but honestly the other lines are not bad at all either), great food options (all local Austin!), water re-fill stations (hate that DFW has not caught onto this trend yet), comfortable seating areas with plenty of plugs, and so much more.Also, it is ONE terminal and completely walk-able. I can not get enough of this place and am so happy it is my second home. Only thing I wish they had was a lounge for those of us with Priority Pass (through AMEX). Seriously if this place had a Centurion Lounge it would be a dream come true. THANKS ABIA!",Before
70," Not a bad airport.  The TSA was very friendly and efficient.  The rental car area is within walking distance of the terminal.  The food options seemed pretty standard, but they had a nice bar with live bands if you have time to kill.  They also had a branch of Waterloo Records in the airport if you have the itch to buy an overpriced album.",Before
71," Always a lover of ABIA. It's small enough to be super accessible (no trams/trains to take here!) to every hate, they offer TSA precheck which is good, and they have all kinds of Austin restaurants inside which is spot on with the Austin motto of Keep Austin Weird. Manga pizza, Schlotzkys deli, Hill's Cafe, Austin Java, Waterloo, Earl Campbell's, Vino Volo, etc. You can get an airport priced alcoholic beverage at Earl Campbell's bar. I recommend the margarita. Yum! About $10 after taxes but before tip.They have a neat art exhibit at the baggage claim as well as pieces throughout the terminals, comfortable enough/large seating while waiting to board, and tons of windows which means light flooding in even on the dreariest of days. Lots of plugs in the walls in case you need a quick charge on your phone! I fly frequently and this is one of my favorite airports other than Seoul Incheon which is gorgeous.",Before
72," Overall it's an ok airport, but the food choices are not as good as people think.Coffee choices are terrible.And please please please could you turn on the A/C once in a while, this airport is always so hot and humid inside.Not an ideal environment before one gets on a flight",Before
78," it's an airport... what do you expect? pretty busy... clean... nice.... i've had few layovers here also, and i didn't have trouble finding an outlet to charge my devices... so that's a plus!",Before
79," Too far from the gates to baggage for handicapped folks. And, it's hard to get a wheelchair. It's Before 9:00 pm and all concessions are closed...you can 't even get a bottle of water!Cool guitar exhibits though.",Before
80," Had my first flying experience flying out of ABIA! All processes of getting on the plane seemed to run smoothly for me, Heather however had more of a struggle. Apparently, there is some luxury makeup that she wears that sets off the chemical alarm when you're going through security. This led ABIA to search through all of her belongings(disorganizing most of it, ugh) and taking her into the full pat-down room. She says it's happened before and that she forgot not to wear that line of makeup. We flew Allegiant to save moolah and the flight was about 30 minutes behind schedule...not sure who to blame on that one. The convenient store food is unsurprisingly high, but they do have protein bars which was great. They have stellar mini-restaurant selections as well, so if you're hungry you should be able to find SOMETHING. My coffee fell out of my hand and spilled everywhere and within minutes they had  custodial personnel cleaning it up (they're on top of it).",Before
81," Best airport in America. Fast coffee stand. $2.00 make it yourself and go from Austin Java! How fast can you get service in another airport. Super clean, super friendly and totally love it when the pilot says "" Now arriving in Austin. Texas""",Before
82," Rental car pick up/drop off was a bit confusing. TSA checkpoint was a breeze. The heat was on full blast, I guess I can understand that considering it was around 40 degrees in Texas. Lots of stores and live music make flying into/out of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport worthwhile!",Before
83," good airport; clean, nice food selection. swift security, modern feeling. definitely world class, but still feels like 'home.'",Before
84," Small, limited food options and few flights. I wanted to eat here but every place has pretty bad reviews on yelp. Just got a $2.99 Kind bar instead :|The plus is that because it is small, you can get through here really quick. I'm worried that this airport is going to be horrible if they don't expand soon, Austin is growing so fast it might not be able to keep up.",Before
85," This is a nice airport. It's incredibly clean and everyone is friendly. I love that they have live music! What a great representation of this musical city. There is beautiful artwork around the terminal as well. Overall, I would say it's not a bad place to have a layover.",Before
86," I love how you immediately know where you are when you step off the plane. It's super unique, with live music, Texas/Austinite art, and delicious food. It's a great place to fly in and out of or have a layover.",Before
87," Pros: Nice and fast check-in Cons:-Too darn small and not enough flights.  Some of you guys comment on the food, ambience, etc.  Seriously?-5x I've flown to NYC and had to stop at either Dallas, Orlando, Chicago or SAN FRANCISCO???  Layovers suck and it actually costs more money because you're paying from that flight to those layover cities too.-Flying international is a nightmare coming out of this airport.  Checked for flight to Brazil from here compared to DC/NY/Chicago.  We are technically closer.   Takes 10-12 hours to fly to Brazil for half the price.  Takes 24-48 hours to fly to Brazil for TWICE the price.-This city and airport are too slow to react to the demand of this growing and densed population.  Stop building the parking lots outward, starting building it upward!",Before
93," Great airport to come through since it's not so huge that it's overwhelming, and it's still small enough that you can race through from one end to the other. There's a good amount of food spots to choose from and if you didn't get your fix of BBQ before you left, you can still stop by to get some from Salt Lick.What I thought was really awesome is that there's a stage in the middle so that you can hear local performers while you wait for your flight! Leave it to Austin to be awesome like that :)",Before
94," Not sure how to write a review for an airport. After being notified that my flight was cancelled after I got to the airport, a few of my friends and I are just sitting and eating. - good amount of places to eat including salt lick bbq! (Other food types include Mexican, Chinese, American, froyo, coffee, and more)- the security check lines aren't terrible depending on when you go. Obviously not the best to travel during holidays. - long term parking is $7 per day. Shuttle service takes you to the terminals.",Before
95, Was only here for an hour to pick up more pax to head over to DC. Our flight was early and I stepped out to crab some food. This airport is fairly clean and various types of good selections. Felt like I was at a food court in Westfiled's malls. I headed over to auntie Anne's soft pretzels cz fresh baked pretzels smells so good. Then I headed to A little coffee shop and ordered an ice mocha to go with my cinnamon pretzel nuggets. The ice mocha wasn't sweet enough for me.,Before
96," As far as airports go, this one is a snap. Rarely are there long lines unless it's a major travel day. Beware of ACL, SXSW and Formula 1 crowds. Those events can bog this smallish airport down. There are good shops and food options. I will say that this airport has some of the more expensive wares that you'll encounter. Most places close up at 8ishSecurity is pretty efficient and I rarely need more than an hour advance arrival. Needs more direct flights, but that's more a carrier issue.",Before
97," I never appreciated Austin's airport until now! I stepped off the plane and walked into some live music in the center of the airport. It made me think of what you would see in the movies if a character was getting off the plane and entering the Live Music Capital of the World for the first time. Perfect scene, and good vibes all around!",Before
98," Love airport parking, long term parking is only $7/day. Affordable for a cheap student like me. Shuttle bus staff is always helpful and polite, they will give you a card so you won't have to worry about forgetting where you parked. It's not a gigantic airport and I love it since I have no sense of direction at all. Live music occasionally to show Austin's spirit.  Try out local restaurants near Gate 12/13, ice cream before your flight is always a great idea.",Before
99," ABIA, don't you ever change! Even with as much as Austin has grown, I still love the fact that, for the most part, I can arrive 45mins before my flt and still have time to spare!I have never eaten at any of the food stops, in the terminal, but they look like better fare offerings than you would find at other, bigger airports. I have also found that gate staff and TSA agents are also, for the most part, friendlier here than at most major airports.And finally, they have free wifi, because for the longest time that was not the case at ABIA. For the first time ever, my home airport is one of my favs to fly out of! Also love that for $2.50 I can take the bus, with only one transfer, from my apt to the ABIA Cap Metro bus stop and not have to deal w/the terrible ATX traffic  overpriced airport prkg!",Before
100," Probably one of the nicest domestic airports I've ever seen. There is only one terminal and there are tons of options for good food, drinks and coffee. The food options are gourmet ones at that. I don't remember seeing a well known fast food restaurant in the whole place except Schlotsky's Deli. Most of the places are local establishments that opened up an additional post at AUS like Salt Lick (BBQ) and Amy's Ice Cream. The decor is also contemporary and fun. My wife mentioned it reminded her of a cross between Zurich International and the newly renovated Cabo San Lucas aiport. I couldn't agree more. It was pretty cool.The security line also is efficient and wasn't long at all when I arrived for my morning flight. No complaints. However what I was most impressed with is the ease at which you can retrieve and drop off your rental car. The car rental booths are right by baggage claim and you take a quick escalator ride to a second level and you are in the parking lot and good to go. This has become my favorite airport but I won't be coming here often unfortunately. Austin is getting too big, too fast.Free Wi-Fi too.",Before
101," No line at TSA? What? TSA agents were super nice!And American Airlines representative was nice? He actually waited next to the kiosk to help me in case I had any questions? Double what?There's a BBQ place - Salt Lick inside, where you can buy BBQ by the lb and gift sets of BBQ sauces :)Also, this is one of the two places that we found in Austin that sells I *heart* TX shirts!Definitely need to get those next time I come in.Clean inside, super nice staff, lots of yummy food places! Oh! And LIVE music.Try Annie's raspberry scone if you feel like something sweet.The flights leave on time! Seriously, only in Texas! Californian flights are ALWAYS late.Oh, and my bag was out before even before I got to the baggage claim.",Before

111, I met Paul Rudd at ATX airport a few years ago and took a picture with him. True story. BOOM!,Before
112," They've done quite a bit in the last few years to update the airport and to try to make it easier to use.  They are in the midst of a large expansion of the parking areas and optimizing the internal space.  The biggest and most significant change for me was finally adding TSA Pre-check lanes to the mix.  While its still not 100% smooth going through security, its orders of magnitude better as has the attitude of most of the staff.Another change is more restaurants, stores and food options, though the lines for some are absurd.  Take the Austin Java near the American gates, you can spend 20 min there just getting a coffee.All in all the airport is making great progress and I look forward to future improvements like maybe taking a train there someday.",Before
113," The airport used to be a great place to go.  After they installed the body scanners its now a regular cluster F.  As a person who doesn't like my rights violated on a regular basis I opt out of the scan of my innards on every flight.  While the people who do this are usually amazingly nice, the process and procedure are beyond reproach.  Hopefully we will soon come to our senses again and ban these horrible machines.  On the upside if you are going somewhere be sure to stop by Salt Lick and pick up a fully cooked brisket to surprise whomever you are going to see.    It always goes over well and the food is great. Another upside is the presidents club upstairs.  If you need a quiet place to retreat after getting your junk handled this is the best bet.",Before
114," Not a bad airport, Like that's its some what small and still has enough for a layover .I got deverted in this airport because of fog.  Was on my way to Houston and this is were the story goes real south.. Had to jump on another 737 to dallas then Ft Lauderdale. Well are 737 came in broke and waited in dallas for 5 hours. Got into florida at 1130pm. Flights from hell.

115," Best airport I've ever visited. Been here twice and enjoyed it both times. People are super friendly and helpful, really different from what I was used to back in NY. Car rental people are also friendly and helpful. This airport gives a great first impression of Austin.",Before
116," I flew out of AUS based on price and flight times, even though San Antonio International (SAT) is closer; I live between Austin and San Antonio. I think comparing the two is fair, even though San Antonio is a little bigger. Based on this first experience, I prefer San Antonio. AUS has a cool vibe with decor and easy gate access in the one terminal but parking was a nightmare. I consider myself to have a good sense of direction and have navigated myself through more than my share of airports but this parking situation was ridiculous. I hope once they finish construction with the parking/rental car garage things will improve. The issue I ran into was while attempting to park in long-term parking, I had my ticket but couldn't find a lot that would open it's access gate arm. There were clearly spots available in the lot but the arm would not raise at the entrance. I noticed other vehicles having the same issue. In the end, I just hopped a curb and parked, returned from my trip with no citation or wheel boot. An advantage over SAT is that parking is cheaper at AUS. Outside of the cheaper parking, I don't see much advantage of flying out OF AUS over SAT considering AUS has fewer airlines and gates.",Before
117, One of the more friendly air ports.Always a pleasure to stop in Texas.purchased a coffee and water wow such a deal under five dollars hard to believe great price and wonderful and very friendly setvice.,Before
118, Great little airport. Travelled during the end of the Holiday season and it took 20 mins to go from checking in at Southwest to going through security. I'm sure times vary. 1. Free WIFI2. Great food court with plenty of options. Went to Thundercloud Sub. $4.99 for a sandwich. No price inflation. Simple and pretty good.**3. You know that awkward gap in between bathroom stalls where people can see you for a millisecond? It's like an unwanted snapchat. But the stalls at this airport have no gap between the door and the stall. You can't look out and no one can peek in. I appreciated the design.,Before
124," ABIA is just big enough to get you most places you want to go nonstop with schedule options, but not so big that getting to your terminal feels like a whole 'nother leg on your trip.  Also noteworthy are the dining options.  Best choice among major hubs in Texas.",Before
125," I have been to the Austin airport a couple of times and I can honestly say that this is a good little airport that is extremely easy to get in and out of. The layout seems extremely user friendly and flows the traffic though quite well. There are some pretty good local places to grab a quick meal, I would recommend Salt Lick, it's pretty dang good! Austin airport, you rock!",Before
126," I like the Austin airport.  I just wish there were more non-stop flights leaving from here, but as is, it is a very clean, and incredibly simple to navigate seeing as how its basically one long slightly curved line with 25 or so gates along the way.  No trams, buses or shuttles to catch to get to non-connected terminals, no confusing intersections with different levels to navigate when you're in a hurry, etc...  There are some decent local food options including a schlotzsky's, Amy's, Mangias, and Salt Lick as well as a few bars with lousy taps and a new wine bar.  A few shops for traveling odds and ends as well as souveniers, but nothing noteworthy really.It's nice that they have live music at times, and also that parking is relatively cheap at around $7 a day for on site long term parking.",Before
127, Multiple parking situations. Easy layout of airport. Decent amount of shops. Not ever too cold or too hot. It's just a really good airport. I'll be using it for as long as I can.,Before
128," Arrived at the airport to go on a little vacation to find out that ALL parking lots, including the garage were full and no parking was available anywhere! Even ""the parking spot"" and ""fast park"" were full. Really?! That's absolutely ridiculous. Never in my life of travel have I ever arrived at an airport which didn't have any more parking available. Come on city planners you have to do something. This town is bursting at the seams. Luckily I arrived with plenty of time and was able to solve my parking dilemma. Would I have missed my flight because of this situation I sure would've been mad.",Before
129," A respectable four-star airport for sure, but I had a pretty awful experience. So I'll give the pros and what I liked since it is an awesome airport and then explain what happened.From the standpoint of an airport, this place is pretty popping. Tons of different restaurant and food options all over the place--you definitely can't get hungry from this place. BUT caveat is that everything does close pretty early so I hope that you don't have a very late flight. I also dug that there's an ample supply of chargers almost everywhere. I traveled close to Christmas time so the place was completely packed, but I was still able to find ample outlet space which was awesome. Thus, even though I was stuck here for five hours, it wasn't too bad. In terms of security, it's interesting to see how they intelligently speed up the security screening process by letting you keep shoes on/not take laptops out--I dug that too. They also have a ton of Ubers outside so it's very easy to get a ride out into the city.The one thing that really bothered me about this airport is from the standpoint of someone who was coming off of a flight here and had never been here. After we got out of our gate, we had no idea where to go... It bothered me that there weren't clearly marked signs about where the exit was. I've been to a ton of different airpots and never have I had this problem until this one. We walked in the wrong direction for a few gates until we finally saw a sign that pointed us in the right direction. A few more signs that actually showed where the baggage claim was would be nice.My dumb experience though--Basically in the mess of holiday travel, the airport messed up our flight information. Since our flight was delayed (understandably), we had to constantly check online about the situation with the flight. Our last check and an email notification had told us that our flight was set to go at 8:30pm at Gate 10. When I checked Gate 10 around 7:50, I noticed that the previous flight hadn't even left yet, not a big deal.l But, when I checked the flight info at 8pm, flighttracker had our flight recorded as left (basically, they mixed it up with the previous flight at the gate.) When I went to the front desk to ask about the flight, the front desk woman was extremely unhelpful. Not only did she just tell me I  was screwed (thanks for trying to help me find a solution??) when my friend came back after checking the actual gate to tell me that they were boarding, the help desk person literally told us that we were definitely wrong and the flight was definitely gone when it was in fact boarding right in front of us. Just a really shitty experience and a lesson in that you really can't mess up flight data... lol had a pretty bad scare. I felt like the person we were with could have been a lot more helpful, and yeah. Definitely spoiled my experience here.tldr; cool airport with great food options, my low rating is due to an unfortunate freak incident.",Before
130," Easy in and out.  Lines not too long and easy to navigate.  I just wish they had more choices of places to hang out in the airport before you have to go through security.  Once you do go through security, there is a plethora of shops and restaurants to satisfy every craving.",Before
131, Just beware of the construction! I've gotten 3 nails in my tires on 3 separate events!!!,Before
132," Small airport, no airline lounges. Good food and fast overall. Not an airport you would want to get stuck in.",Before
133," It's a good enough airpot. I appreciate the vendors that sell fresher, less packaged foods (fruit, salads, etc). But I wish the wifi was more secure; I'd even pay for a upgraded option there. The navigation in and out of the airport is really good and clear, as is the pathway from the car rental area to the terminals. It's rarely too crowded, like LAX, JFK, or SFO. It's a nice mid range airport.",Before
139," I have done a lot of flying over the years and have been all over but this is by far my favorite airport. It may not have as many flight options but this little airport has a style that is authentic to Austin. There is local art, live music, Austin bbq, and they have both United and American lounges for the fancy people.",Before
140," I've been to a decent number of airports in the states and ABIA is one of my favorites. It's small but not ""only scary prop planes or private jets"" small. There is only one terminal, which makes it super easy to get around. You don't have 5 options for terminals, where you rely on trams to get to the right terminal for a connecting flight that leaves 30 minutes after your last plane landed. :) It's low stress. There are several security checkpoints - as long as you aren't flying on a super busy day (SXSW, F1, ACL or the typical holidays), the wait to get through security typically isn't too long. I've only once have had it take me over 30 minutes. I was flying at a popular time for business travelers. The main drawback for me is the lack of food options and entertainment at the terminal. I'm a weird Austinite that hates loud, live music and not big on BBQ. :/ That's the bulk of entertainment and dining at ABIA. The airport does seem to be a pretty good ambassador, welcoming people to Austin and giving them their first glimpse of touristy Austin.",Before
141," Small airport, but it gets the job done. Lots of local Austin eateries inside the terminal if you want something to eat, and several cute shops full of Austin and Texas merchandise. Bathrooms are clean, too!",Before
142," I have been in ABIA many times and although they are trying to make some improvements, I still feel this airport is way behind the times as compared to other international airports. The traffic in and out of Austin is astonishing and I think with the amount of people we have going through the city we need a larger airport with a lot more amenities. I believe there are only about 2 or 3 real restaurant/bar areas and everything else is to-go items. I'd love to have a place to actually hang out when there are long layovers or delayed flights that is a little more cozy and separated than the current options available. It would also be nice if there were more places for people waiting on arrival flights to enjoy their time.",Before
143," I hate early flights. Usually there's no food stands open to buy water or a pastry and it seems so deserted. This was not the case when I got to Austin International Airport.It was a lot busier than I expected. On the drive in we could see a lot of parking areas with covered stalls. Once at the terminal, we hit a line of cars but we're able to get to United's drop off area with ease (FYI it's one of the first airlines). I checked in quickly and passed through TSA in less than 10minutes. For 5 o'clock in the morning they were very friendly with a longer line. I was also happy to see a lot of food options open ranging from coffee  pastries to breakfast sandwiches. The bookstores were open and even better, FREE wifi! The holding areas were also clean. There are a few outlets in each area but I came charged today. Won't mind flying through Austin next time, well if there's a next time.",Before
144," Airport was not tiny but not huge, and offered some places that had live music. They also had TSA Precheck designated lines, which are always nice. Looked like it had been renovated fairly recently. Biggest downside is that since it isn't a major hub, you're liable to have problems if the feeder planes have a problem.Earl Campbell's place at the airport was nice to grab a quick bite, a beverage, some popcorn, etc.",Before
145," Fun, small ""international"" airportThis is one of the coolest little airports I've seen.  It's small, but has cool art, a great selection of restaurants, and rocking art installations.  Time through security is relatively quick and the people working at the airport are actually pleasant to chat with.  Gates are clean and nicely kept.Three tips: First, allow yourself an extra hour driving time to get to the airport if you leave your hotel anywhere near o during rush hour.  It was a crawl at times!  Second, they have crappy free WiFi.  The speed was actually great.  It's just that Yelp!, Facebook, and some other sites were all giving errors when I tried to visit them.  Other sites loaded quickly and without problem.  But it was so hit-and-miss that I just switched back to cellular.  Last, there aren't as many outlets as you would think for a newer airport. Lots of folks are searching for spots to recharge their phones.Still can't believe this is considered and international airport, though.  It's so cute and small for the caliber airport that comes to my mind when I see the designation.",Before
146," I've been through the Austin airport a few times now.This one of those that's actually a little outside (but not as far as Pittsburgh Intl) Austin. Make sure you have enough time to get there.I've flown in and out of here on a bunch of different airlines, and the ticketing has always been a breeze. There's always a line, but it tends to more fairly quickly. Security here seems smaller than some other places, but I think that's just because this building as a whole is more open.If you're connecting through here, be advised: its shaped like a horseshoe (it is Texas after all).So don't be surprised if you have to run around the entire thing to connect.This was one of the 1st airports I went to that had an ample number of food options. They've got just about everything from BBQ, to bars, to Mickey D's for you boring folks. The one thing I could NOT find in this entire place (ie: any newsstand/ convenience kiosk) was gingerale.I very much enjoy having to fly into or out of this airport. It's far superior to its southeast neighbors, especially Hobby in Houston.",Before
147," The security line was SUPER FAST!! I was actually surprised by how easy and quick it was!!! It's a small airport but it runs pretty efficiently. Unfortunately it was too early to try any restaurants when I arrived but there's a Waffle House near the airport, so I ate before I arrived!! Yeah for Waffle House!!!!",Before
148, Small but efficient.  TSA lines were quick and friendly - probably the best out of all the airports I've gone through the last few years.Dining options were decent considering we were there so ungodly early.Would fly through here again.  Polite staff all throughout.,Before
154," Good for an airport. Hung out at the salt like when we got bumped of our flights (for a nice fee). Pricey of course, but food's decent. The wine place near gate 15 looks cool too. Security is smooth and courteous. Hope to be back.",Before
155," Much smaller than i expected. How they handle the surge of SXSW, ACL, and F1 i dont know. Even during bad traffic it takes 30 min from town. Fairly new a few terminals with decent good options and even a band playing. Getting in and out being easy is a huge key plus here. Wish most metro airports were this easy",Before
156," Easy to get in and out of this airport without necessarily having to arrive two hours before your flight.  Not a lot of restaurants, but some decent choices if you're not too much of a health nut.  Short check-in and security lines.  Gotta love that.",Before
157," Had to come early in the morning to catch our flight. It was relatively easy to find our way around. It took a bit even at 6 am to get through security. The screens said 10 minute wait max but definitely felt much longer than that. Also, people were rude and would cut you in line at security and even the shops (come on! the rest of the city is so nice!).",Before
158," Easy access, simple layout, and reasonable proximity to downtown and UT make the Austin airport a pleasure to use for air travelers. Don't be surprised if you stumble across a seemingly deserted concourse (dead times seem to outnumber busy times), but it is never a bad idea to arrive early.  There are no distracting bars filled with bored (alcoholic) passengers (like the unholy Vegas port) and no need for trains or trams (like Dallas and Atlanta).  And, I'm a sucker for Schlotsky's so arriving hungry is never a problem.",Before
159," I just wanted to state that I felt I was discriminated against by my looks alone. On Oct 11 on our flight from this airport to LAX, at Security, I had two ladies ask if me I spoke English without even TRYING to initially communicate with me. They plain looked at me and asked if I spoke English, and kept asking my husband ""Can you ask her..."" without trying to even to talk to me first or even say ""Hello"" to me - just went over my head. I felt that that I received poor service because of this! The 2 ladies were very rude to me, and could not even try  to explain what THEY WANTED and needed from me. My husband and I were traveling with our 5 month old infant, so we had all this baby gear that needed to go through security and I felt like I was talking to teenagers with their scoffing and inability to keep their cool. Simple communication as adults would have been enough. I've worked in customer service and also security (as my last job before the baby), and this is the complete opposite of what we were taught as employees, so how much more should they hold a higher standard of quality in an airport. These people looked mad before I even got to them. Horrible service!! I understand they have a stressful job, but honestly who doesn't.I am just as stressed traveling with an infant, also on emergency to visit my grieving mom because my dad just passed away the day before. The people at security at gate 14 working at 10/11/14 before 4pm should definitely be re-evaluated. We also missed our flight, because they did not know what to do with our stroller. If they could have just informed us before hand and not after-wise. Also, in their website, they do not specify that jogging strollers cannot be checked at the gate, or will need extra care at the security gate. This is by far the worst experience I have had at an airport.",Before
160," It's not perfect, but it does just fine. It's surprisingly well-connected for a small-to-medium sized airport with pretty convenient nonstop flights to most places I go: San Jose, DC, New York, etc. I'm a huge fan of Southwest, so the fact that they do a very good job serving Austin makes me happy.The food options are limited, but decent. I mostly get breakfast tacos with eggs and brisket from the salt lick taco bar or similar tacos from Earl Campbell's--the sports-themed fast food place.",Before
161," Great little airport. Easy access in and out, about 15 miles from downtown. The rental car tax was close to 50%! Regardless, National's Emerald Aisle had several makes and models including VW Jetta, Nissan Altima, Toyota CRV, Ford Fusion, etc.Inside the airport, the TSA staff was more personable than most other airports. Past security there are a ton of food joints and I think three bars (Earl Campbell's, Saxon's Pub and a Honkytonk looking place). Service at Earl's and the Honkytonk (Rob's?) bar was quick and friendly. They also had live music at both places. On a side note, there is live music everywhere in Austin and every musician or band that I've heard could be on a record label and perform anywhere. I mean the level of talent in this city is unbelievable. Austin is to music what Hollywood is to film, what the San Fernando Valley is to porn, what SF is to homelessness.",Before
162, Easy airport to get around in.  The music vibe is cool.  Security check needs some work.,Before
163, There are a few spots for parking if you are going to pick someone up.  People are crazy when they are heading out or coming back to the airport.  People will cut you off in your car just to let someone out or pick someone up.  There is an upper area to drop someone off and then a lower level to pick someone up.  Airport is moderately sized and busy.,Before
169," With the exception of holiday weekends and an often lack of service at the curb (yes you southwest with your one skycap!) austin is one of my fave airports-Generally easy to check in, baggage comes out pretty fast, and who doesn't love live music and BBQ at the airport??Annie's and Vino Vilo are two of the more recent additions and they add some class and deliciousness to the regular fare.All in all I will take you over LAX on any given day;)",Before
170," The airport is clean and staff is helpful.  I love how short the security lines are and it states how many minutes in line you will have to wait.  That's so helpful if you want to stay with family and friends that are not flying out. However,  the food selection outside the security check out is limited.  They need to have more selections outside. There are a lot inside the airport.Overall, good airport...I come here often.",Before
171," Parking accessible. Short wait. However, not much to eat or drink outside of security of you're here with someone not flying out.",Before

173, This airport is home to me.  Simple enough to get in and out.  Sometimes I can even pick up the 30 min free wifi from the cell phone lot.  The welcoming music.  The clean bathrooms - let's admit it - we all hold our bowels and use the bathroom at any airport that we land atThis also has the fastest customs experience I've had coming back from Mexico.,Before
174," This one terminal airport has always frequently offered cheaper flights to Denver/ Colorado Springs, Colorado than my current place of residence in San Antonio. Offers quick security, that has a time clock outside of the line that says the average time to get through the line at that moment. Also has an array of restaurants and vending options after you pass through security. My favorite however, is located before you enter security near the Frontier entrance. Its a vending machine for flowers by Flowerama. So if you forget and are picking up that special someone, there you go!",Before
175," Overall, Austin is a great airport. It's big but not huge, meaning it has the amenities you want but is not overwhelming. Wifi is free and fast. The whole place is very clean. There are plenty of taxis available, and it's about 15 minutes to downtown depending on time of day.In pure Austin style, there were at least three live music acts around the airport...at 4pm...on a Thursday. At least one was really quite good, and the others I did not hear enough of to judge. Really great airport!",Before
176," Austin-Bergstrom airport is one of the most stress-free airports to fly in or out of. The airport is close to the city, check-in is easy with plenty of kiosks and attendants to help, TSA lines are well organized and move very quickly, gates are all relatively close together (so don't worry about having to run to a different terminal if you have a short connection), and local offerings are plentiful (e.g., Saltlick, Mangia, Amy's Ice Cream, etc..) A few other things I was pleasantly surprised to discover: - There's no need to take a shuttle to pick-up or drop-off your rental car. The lot for all rental cars (minus Silvercar) is right outside the departure area. SO. MUCH. TIME. SAVED!!!!- Free wifi- Vending machines with fresh flowers in the baggage claim area -- in case you fellas forget! You're welcome ;) - Plenty of outlets everywhere if you need to recharge your electronics- Souvenir prices are reasonable and comparable to prices you would find in the city",Before

179," Picked up a relative here yesterday. Did the cell phone waiting area. Parked in a bit of shade. Waited and drive up to the pickup area. Let my car run for 6 minutes with AC, just so I could break the rule on the sign. Many a-holes go down the left lane by pick up. I of course patently waited and a little lady tried to cut in front of me. I got a great look and she motioned I was number 1. Anyway picked up my pick up and got the heck out of there. Welcome to Austin, home of the rudest and most impatient drivers who think common courtesy and rules don't apply to them!",Before

186," Pretty solid regional airport!  Nice food choices, easy in and out!",Before
187," Overall a fairly decent airport. I've been to a few and this one is, by far, the cleanest, simplest, best laid out AP so far.Airports are notoriously a pain the rump, so its nice to know when I have to travel, or grab a car, my life will not be trampled on and toppled upside down. Catching your plane is painless. Grabbing a car is painless. Returning a car is painless. The only thing I ever have issues with is retrieving my luggage.. Somehow I never know where to go..  But that's probably my fault. Not sure. Not anything to complain about..I just ask...there is always some close who knows and eagerly helps.Lots of shops, organic eateries. Organic coffee! Security check can sometimes make you wish you had stayed at home.. But that's everywhere. For an airport... Its nice. Come check it out. You'll leave impressed....I hope!!",Before
188," Great airport, easy in/out. Taxis are ample and available quickly outside.  Security lines are not bad at all. Staff all friendly. They could use some more restaurant options (especially healthy ones).",Before
189, I loved hearing live music the second we stepped off the plane. Not a large airport and nothing too fancy. Friendly service and a pretty good layout.,Before
190," This is one of the most user friendly and easy to navigate airports I have travelled through, which is amazing for a city the size of Austin.  Rental Cars are also easily accessible.  Many food choices too!",Before
191," Hands down the worst parking experience I have ever had!  It shouldn't take you 45 minutes to get from the curb to your car!! And this is normal here, I fly out of here multiple times per month and each time it takes no less than 30 minutes to get to my car.  I'm looking for another parking service. Did I mention this parking is terrible AND expensive.  It would be different if they were cheap and had bad service!  And now they just dropped me off at the wrong stop and I have to walk half a mile to my car!! EPIC Fail ABIA Parking again!!!!!",Before
192, Large enough to service this city yet feel small.  Rental car pickup and return directly across from the terminal.  Not difficult to get through security.  Decent dining and amenities.,Before
193," This is a very nice, well marked airport. I love the light from all of the windows. There are plenty of restaurants including a mini Salt Lick where you can get one last taste of real BBQ before flying out of Texas!There's free wifi and going through the TSA lines was relatively painless. This was a short stint into Austin and back out in a day and the speed of this airport makes this do-able. Painless trip, and I'm glad to see there are far more nonstop flights to the West Coast!",Before
194," Clean, organized, plenty of places to eat.I feel very safe and has a calming feeling instead of the usual tension when flying.It makes our NY-NJ Airports out dated.It even has parking/stopping place for cellphone pickup. No more congestion on the pick up area outside the airport.Keeping the police where they are needed to be more, not in the airport pick up area controlling traffic.Good idea Austin!",Before
200, Love the new Cell Phone Lot! Sure beats driving 'round and 'round and risking getting a ticket!,Before
201," From the moment I landed at this airport, I loved everything about Austin. I used to fly through LAX mostly and now through EWR; both are terrible and the worst. This airport is much better. Nice food options, small and easy to get through (was at my gate in 20 minutes after I got there maybe less) , rental cars are just a walk across the street. It is a smaller airport as Dallas is only about an hour or so away. Out of airports this size, it's definitely four star worthy.",Before
202," Not bad, has several places to eat as well as shops to buy all of your Texan souvenirs and some BBQ sauces.I was flying SW, and going through security was fast, no need to take off shoes, and take out laptops. Perhaps it was the line I was in, as I notice some other lines you needed to take off shoes and have a separate bin for laptops.It was not super busy on Labor Day, and overall the experience was not bad.There is free wifi, and also filtered water.",Before
203," Literally my fave airport in the world!   If I am being dropped off at the airport, I typically need to arrive 1 hr before my flt   If I am driving, I arrive 1 1/2 hr before my my flt.   If one security line is long, I can jump to another line w/o any problems.  The overall energy of the airport is much more laid back than most  definitely cleaner too. I especially enjoy arriving in austin from my travels.",Before
204, Easy to navigate and decent food (quick options too). I like that it's bright and open and security has gone pretty quickly every time I've been through as well.,Before
205, Easy to navigate and get through security.,Before
206," This place is cool. I love the art vibe, unfortunately ALMOST everything was closed by 8pm when I got there - so that sucked! So I wasn't able to eat because all the restaurant spots were all closed. However, it was so small that I was able to rush out for a smoke and come back in during my layover.",Before
207," One of my absolutely favorite airports in the U.S. it is simply designed, security is very efficient, and you have a nice variation in eating. When traveling into Texas, this is my preferred airport.",Before
208," Edit: The construction and signage issues below seems to be finished now and by and large the airport is great for quick pickups and dropoffs. The parking does still need some work though. As a lifelong Austinite and pilot, I have mixed feelings about ABIA. In the past, when I was picked up and dropped off at the curb, I really liked the airport. As a Class C airport, it is more focused on domestic travel so the crowds and lines just aren't as bad. It can be a bit more difficult to get a direct flight (depending on where you are going) but that is simply the price you pay for not living in a big city. You can pretty much count on changing planes in Dallas or Houston before you get where you are going.As I said though, as a passenger I always liked the airport. Security lines are never terribly long and this terminal has a nice open and airy feel to it. I still like the old airport better but that is long gone now. I also still reminisce about the days when this was an Air Force Base but that is also long gone now.My experience changed a few days ago though when I had to drop off a friend of mine. Trying to find the short-term parking lot ""A"" was a bit of a nightmare. Admittingly, there was quite a bit of construction going on that day, so I hope it is a temporary situation but I must have driven around the airport a dozen times before I finally found the entrance to lot A. I don't know if they have fixed it since, but all of the critical signs were very well hidden behind some overgrown trees, completely invisible until after you've committed to an exit. The exit from the parking lot itself was also well hidden. The orange construction signs marked ""exit"" kept you driving in an infinite circle and did not actually lead to any kind of exit. Once I finally found the exit of my own accord (and a bit of luck), the rest was rather painless.I just have to imagine that someone at the airport decided to play a prank on everyone that day. Surely, the City can't really be THAT incompetent by accident? I'll be going back in a few minutes to see if anything has changed. I've navigated some really confusing airports before (i.e. DFW during their construction nightmares) but this was pretty bad. Hopefully, they get that fixed. From another perspective though, I do enjoy flying into ABIA as a pilot. The private aviation (GA) side of the airport is quite nice with ample and close parking. You do have to do a fast approach so that they can sequence you in between the jets, but this leads to a long float, quick exit from the runway and very short taxi back to the tie down spots if you time everything just right. To pilots looking to fly in, I would recommend the airport, just be ready to ""make best speed"" on approach. Not the best airport for timid or slow pilots, but otherwise a nice place to fly into. The GA side of the airport would probably get about 4.5 stars from me.",Before
209," The parking is easy.  The rental cars are right next to the terminal - no shuttles needed.  The TSA agents are friendly. The food, whether texmex, BBQ, or American, is all great.",Before
215, Good layout and various food to eat while you wait for your flight. I think an expansion will be needed in the near future because a lot more people are flying out of the Texas capital.,Before
216," This airport is among the easiest to navigate. I try to fly out of here vs San Antonio whenever possible. The signage is good and easy to read. TSA is polite and lines move quickly. Not enough to do sometimes when you're waiting and they need more power outlets, but never a bad experience especially with free wifi.",Before
217, despite being the capital city with many airlines flying in the lack of direct international flights is ridiculous. Food options are good with live free music sometimes. Parking also can be tight during acl,Before
218," Small, well-designed airport. While average in most respects, I'll give it the extra star for two reasons: you can get brisket tacos here from Salt Lick, and you can easily take a bus to the heart of downtown for $1.50, replete with plenty of room for your luggage.",Before
219," I really like the ATX airport. It's unlike any airport I've ever been to. The restaurants are actual ATX local spots and they have live music. Well Austin is the Live Music Capitol of the World after all, so it only makes sense. Security has been pretty quick the last few flights I've had as well as checking in. I still try to get there between 1.5-2 hours before my flight just to be safe though. Stop by the Salt Lick Taco Stand and get yourself a brisket taco - you won't regret it!",Before
220, Lovely airport... Not very big but wasn't expecting it to be considering Austin isn't big itself. Great friendly staff...didn't have to wait long at all although that probably had something to do with the time we were due to fly. Barely made my flight though,Before
221," Okay, I travel quite a bit and have seen all kinds of airports all over the world.  This is a place that you could schedule to have a layover and by very happy, well fed and entertained.  Live music fills the air, kitchen odors from the top of the line restaurants, not the airport chains.  Lots of places to pull up a chair and just relax.  Speaking of relaxing, they even have a place to get a massage.  Just keeping Austin weird.",Before
222," Probably one of my favorite terminals in any US airport. Very clean, people is super super nice, lots of places to eat and buy souvenirs.I don't know if it was luck or not , but it took me only  2 minute to pass the TSA area!",Before
223, Awful experience. They don't even put up signs to let you know lots are full. I would advise using other parking options like the parking spot,Before
224," The Austin Airport, like most things in Austin is over rated.  While the Austin airport does not do anything horribly, it doesn't do anything great either.  It's an average airport with average amenitiesThere are food options, music, and most anything else you would expect to find in a Texas airport; it has the feeling of being run down a bit.  It is nice to have rental cars across the street at the airport, but waiting for luggage is never a short process.  If they could improve the luggage situation, then breezing to the rental cars would be much more enjoyable.",Before

231," This is Hands down one of the best airports I have  ever been too. efficient security , courteous airline staff (thanks Delta), but I really think the airport reflects Austin's   local culture very well. Sadly, No music when I was there (was expecting this) but that  does not affect this rating on this review. Where else can you get live music at the airport. Loved the local restaurant. scene.

I was crying, asking if I could just have one bottle and was one minute later, as I ran alone through the airport with two small kids (baby and toddler). The staff at the terminal were very nice and found me the next flight very quickly. The cafe was really clean and the food was great, however, the staff could use some Austin hospitality. Good and bad at this airport. Overall I'm just happy to be flying!",Before
238," I found myself coming back from a road trip to Austin from Chicago - requiring that I fly back. This is an airport that doesn't seem to have those over-crowded and stressful issues like so many others, which is nice. It seems easy in, easy out.I flew out on July 4th just before noon. The staff was cool and efficient. There seemed to be good food choices. I opted for water and a protein bar. And it was nice not to feel ripped off, price wise. I'd stop in again ... even at other locations.",Before
239," I'm not gonna be a full hater on AUS, but definitely going to keep it a 3 star and no mas because they have some good things and some issues.This is the first time I've ever flown in here and the arrival was pretty easy.  I stopped in a store to get a phone charger since I forgot mine and then they had WWII vets coming through and everyone stopped and applauded them.  I paid out as soon as I could so I could also go applaud and also because I love little old men.  Of course I also started tearing up and they were all looking at me like ""aww what's wrong little lassy?""  I couldn't help it, they are little dolls.  Once I got out of the airport, picking up the rental was also easy.So fast forward to the trip back.  I got to the airport way early (like 4+ hours early) to check in, grab a seat at a bar, and hopefully watch the race while I waited.  Melissa A is totally right - there are no obvious signs to tell you where food/drink is located.  I finally found the touchscreen thing and figured out where the sports bar was but those things are not easily located.So I roll up at the sports bar and sit at the bar.  The bartender on duty was a very surly girl, I didn't see her act friendly or smile at anyone.  At all.  I asked about turning the TV that was on TNT btw to the race.  She says she's not the one that does it, so told the older lady working the pickup counter as ""she's the one that does the remote"".  20 minutes go by....nothing.  Then the lady grabs the remote and turns all those TVs on soccer.  Hey, I'm all for soccer I guess, but I had already asked and I only asked for one!  GAAAH!  I was a pouty, whiny baby in my head.  The guy beside me even said ""hey, didn't you ask for the race?""  Yes, but I am not getting it.  So I paid out because I'll be damned if I'm going to spend $$ on drinks all afternoon while watching soccer and getting waited on by a surly bartender.  No thanks.So off I go to the Ray Benson's Roadhouse where I parked it at the bar.  I get a drink and a bbq sandwich ordered up from an awesome bartender named Joshua.  Once I noticed that the guy beside me was checking his phone for NASCAR updates as well and that the TV in front of us was on women's softball, I asked if he could turn it over to FOX.  And no problem, let's do it.  So Joshua saved the day plus he suggested I try Deep Eddy vodka and he was friendly and chatty.  Great service, nice guy.  I was pleased, tipsy, and happy.  It ROCKED.  And I paid it back by giving him a special hefty tip!  Plus apparently they have live music sometimes so you can rock out as you wait.Other things: not a lot of departure gate signs.  You have to hope that your gate didn't change as you can't find signs to look at.  Plenty of shops with tons of Texas related stuff - the outfits I got for my twin nieces are AWESOME.  Plenty of souvenirs if you want to wait until the airport to get it.  The TSA line was longer than I expected, but it was Sunday and it didn't go as painfully slow as I initially thought it was going to go...so that's good.This is definitely by no means the worst airport I have been to, but I am not putting it on my favorites list.  However, if you find yourself there, might as well go to the Roadhouse and holla at Joshua.",Before
245," Love this airport, but everything closes really early.  It's also fairly unpredictable in terms of security line wait times.  It's small (20ish gates) so it's really easy to get around, and I love the local flavors offered (when stuff is open).",Before
246," I have flown in and out of Austin a lot the past month and I have to say I really enjoy this airport.  It is smaller than my current home base, but it has everything a good airport needs and then some!  Here are some of the highlights:1. It's all one terminal, so it is easy to navigate.  No crazy trams, shuttles, tunnels or the other craziness that I am used to.2. They usually have live music in the middle of the gates.  Who doesn't love live music in the music capital of the world?3. A lot of good food options.  If you didn't already know, Austin is big on Austin owned restaurants, so the airport is in strict compliance with Austin only joints.  This is nice so you can get your last bit of Austin to take with you on the plane home.4. Free wifi and lots of plugs to charge up your devices!  Always a plus!5. Since it is a smaller airport, everything is close together and easy to get in and out of.  The parking is close, the rental car area is right next to baggage claim, and it is just easy and time efficient.  Yay for that!So this is a great airport.  Come to Austin to check it out for yourself!",Before

249," For a relatively small airport and exceedingly over crowding number of TSA officers, the least hectic time to check customers takes 20 minutes.  LAX, Dallas, Houston take about the same time. Not to mention all the big city airports have a line for military members, this airport and Airlines in the airport offer no information or assistance to inform military members of pre TSA eligibility until you enter the security checks and is like pulling teeth; to include the negative attitude you get for asking and get snobby to challenge the fact I should be ashamed or stupid to all what other big city airports offer at first hand.  They handle hundreds of customers and never have them disrespected any customers.",Before
250," Super fast walk through TSA, didn't need to take off shoes,  belt, laptop or anything. Awesome... The gates and rental cars are super close. Basically an overall well processed airport. I just wish the planes from other locations would be on time like this airport. 5 stars...",Before

261, I love Austin. It's such a hip city. So it's not surprising that there are bands playing at the airport on Friday evenings. Never seen that anywhere else! It's freaking awesome. Also the airport is super easy to navigate and you can walk across the street to get a car. No shuttles to car returns either! They need better food at the airport tho. I'm always hungry on my way home and there's never food open late enough!,Before
262," Very cool huge colorful guitar display! I have yet to catch a live music performance but what a unique feature. Overall I love how the airport has a fun artsy vibe to complement the city.Relatively quick experiences with going through security and boarding so far. Easy dropoffs and pickups as well.Always appreciate free wifi, it is accessible for 30 minutes I think.",Before

265," I have never had any concerns here, but they are growing and the construction work flow does hinder your simple travels.Be cautious when going to the extended parking area, right now with all of the constructions many of the gates do not work and there are no signs to tell you that you MUST ENTER from a single point; this was really frustrating when I had to loop the entire lot and parking area to come back to that position and enter the parking area.  Additionally, pedestrian signage could be much better for construction areas. Sure, it tells you the entrance to get to the terminal, but when you are a long ways from that sign there is nothing directing you to the location. So you could end up making an extra hike to get to the terminal.  TSA security has to process many people, but some of their courtesies could be improved. I was traveling with kids and it seems that their delays were a surprise to a few agents; seriously? Kids do what they do and mine listen well, but when I am in a crowded area I pay special attention to them and not force them through the crowds and keep them in my sight.  Most TSA agents saw this and understood, but a few (unnamed) really should consider it or take another break to relax some.  Overall, the airport is growing and improving. They still have much to learn and grow to earn more stars from me.",Before
266," As far as airports go, this one is up there with Love Field for similar reasons:- Not super crowded and the check-in lines flow quickly- Really good shops, bars and restaurants to refresh and kill time between flights- The staff throughout the airport are friendly, helpful and full of positivity",Before

I there's decent amount of places to chow in this airport from down and dirty hot dogs to healthy salads and more. Some establishments have performers representing what Austin is known for, their music. I think it's pretty cool to sip on a beer and hear a nice live song. I like this place.",Before

I had a little trepidation flying into Austin, since I'm a proud AM Grad and generally hate anything associated with the word Longhorn. But, Austin-Bergstrom, is spacious, inviting, and a most pleasant place to change planes. The highlight was taking off and flying directly over the Texas State Capital.",Before

270," I really wanted to give this airport more than 3 Stars, but it shows you how important TSA and security are to the airport experience.  I'm a business traveler and fly a few times a week.  This TSA group is without a doubt the poorest I have encountered. They are in dire need of retraining....an airport this size should not have the wait times of a much larger airport.  If they could fix this issue Austin would be a 5 Star experience.Positives - outstanding food selections..especially considering the size of the airport. Great tunes and really cool displays throughout the airport. Only about 20 or so gates....So once you make it through the horrific security experience you are on easy street.",Before

My colleague witnessed people in tears due to flights being missed because of the slow lines? Watched a woman not able to bring an urn of ashes through security? Simply awful! Now...as a disclaimer it did seem to me that they were training in new TSA employees, so hopefully this is not a long term issue, but just in case please plan accordingly!!!Travel and Leisure voted this one of the top airports in the US, and I will agree on the size, clean factor, music, and good food. Still can't give it more stars due to the wait factor...",Before
279," Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is where I have said countless hellos and goodbyes. In college, I said goodbye to Richard, my best friend. He had saved my life, you know. I had appendicitis, but the ER kept kicking me out of the hospital, doped up on Morphine to calm me down from the pain, but they didn't know what was wrong. He bumped my roommate out of our shared efficiency dorm room, stayed with me for three days, hauled me to the ER and back 2 more times and finally spent six hours back at the hospital, holding my hand, refusing to let them discharge me until my parents could get there. My appendix burst during the operation. At the end of that semester our group of friends went skydiving together. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Then I bought Richard a journal, asked him to write in it to me every day, and we went to ABIA to see him and his two Australian counterparts off, back to Oz.I miss the days when you could wait at the terminal with loved ones. When you could be with them just until the moment they left and actually watch their plane take off. I sat for a long time at the little cafe after they all left. And I cried and watched people come and go. And I never saw him again. That was around 9 years ago. He was a very good friend. He sends me a message once every year on my birthday. That was my first ever experience at the airport in Austin. For a long time after that, I never flew anywhere and probably for 5 years or so never went back. But now, for the past three years, my husband has worked out of state and we drop him off and pick him up at ABIA, frequenting twice a month. I have videos of my daughter, who is now four, seeing him from a distance, screaming ""Daddy!"" and running up to put her arms around his neck, from the time she could barely walk and barely say his name until now. I will be able to stream them together to watch her grow as she greets him at every homecoming. And every month we drive to the drop off, we put on the hazards, and we say brief goodbyes. I miss the days when we could have gone in and sat with him, let her sit with him until the moment he had to leave. Sometimes, when I drop him off, we've been fighting, and he'll walk away, through those automatic doors, without looking back once, without saying a word. The drive away then is very hard. And sometimes, when I drop him off, we're dreading the moment we part and he can't hug me long enough and he turns around and blows me a kiss. The drive away then is very hard. We won't have to do much of this anymore. But there is a lot of emotion tied into my memories of the arrivals and departures I've experienced at ABIA. .",Before
280," I loved this airport - L-O-V-E-D it. It's not as huge as I expected it to be for a large city and touristy place like Austin, but it's plenty big enough and run very efficiently.  I arrived at 10am for a 12:15 flight this morning and I had checked a bag and gone through security and was sitting at my gate by 10:19.  The employees were very friendly - I was laughing and joking with them the whole way through security and bag check - and they run a very tight ship but do it well and with obvious pride.  No one seemed put-out by their jobs or like they were grumpy about it which is nice because I already hate flying so when the TSA employees are disgruntled it doesn't help the experience... I like the layout of this airport - it's in a sort of semi-circle and the gate numbers are easy to find as they go around the circle with a few shops and food and a big Salt Lick BBQ and food/bar area in the middle.  I didn't have any issues here and I had a very easy and pleasant flight in and out while visiting an old friend for a 4-day Austin weekend.",Before

If you missed breakfast, get a breakfast taco...don't forget the bbq sauce!There's also a great clothing shop if you forgot to pick up a ""Keep Austin Weird"" t-shirt for a loved one you're about to visit.Parking is expensive if you want covered and close.  I recommend The Parking Spot which is located off 183 heading SE.  Remember to make a reservation the day  before!  They are not first come first serve.  The Parking Spot has covered parking for every car.  The covered airport parking is very expensive.  The uncovered long term parking is cheaper, but with precarious Texas weather and resulting Texas hail, I wouldn't risk it.If you're in ATX for business, please don't stay at a hotel close to the airport.  Get a hotel downtown, or better yet, on South Congress!  At the very least stay in a bnb somewhere in Rosedale or Hyde Park!I'm sure this would be a great airport to stalk the baggage claim just before ACL or SXSW!",Before

The easiest way to get to the airport from North is either to take Airport Blvd (natch) or 183, especially if you're trying to make it down while it's more crowded in traffic.  Let's say you're picking up someone.  Lo!  There is a Cell Phone Parking Lot (CPPL).  In this parking lot there are benches, plenty of parking and restrooms (thank goodness, because there are delays on incoming planes from time to time).  From here you can wait for your passenger to call you or text you.  You can also people-watch everyone else who is waiting for their pickup, which is always the most fun of going to the airport.  You can also scowl at the people who leave their cars on even though there are signs asking you to turn your motor off after 5 minutes of idling.The bad:  You may miss the CPPL like I did the first time (the entrance sign has no arrow indicating it is right instead of ahead, though all the other signs DO) and you may have to do a roundabout to come back and turn left into the CPPL.  Takes about thirty seconds and your lost pride.It takes you, oh, a minute tops to drive over and pick up your passenger. Make sure they tell you what entrance they are at (it's an alphabetic system) and you'll be on your way shortly.  Don't speed out of there because the cops that pepper the airport will stop and ticket you.",Before
291," This is one of the better mid to small sized airports in the country.  It's always well kept for as busy as it gets.I have no choice but to fly out of here because it's the closest to me personally... and I've been to many different airports around the country.  This one is cozy, clean and efficient.  You really can't say much more about an airport than that.It's a bit frustrating that they've been building upgrades to it for a while, but I'd imagine that it will only improve the place once it's complete.Again, what can you really say about an airport?  4 stars.",Before
292," Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is a bit of a strange beast, while I like the airport for it's intimate size and generally friendly staff, I feel that for being an international airport in the capital city of Texas it can do far better. The airport is very ""Austin"" I will give it that, but most of the services like shoe shine or massage or anything like that always seem to be closed when I am there. The other strange thing about this airport is there does not seem to be any ""sit down"" restaurants with table service. I feel the airport needs to look at its services and get them up to par with other international airports.",Before
293," Only in Austin,Texas at Austin Bergstrom International Airport can you grab a burger at one of your favorite hometown places, go sit outside a bar with a beer and listen to a live band, all while you wait for a plane to rush you away to a far off place!",Before
294," I love this airport. Free wifi, modern architecture, it's better than most airports out there.",Before
295," My how you have grown up. I remember back in the old days when you were a little bitty thing right next to IH35.  Do you remember the time when I was running  late and was sweating it as we navigated the horrible traffic on Airport Boulevard? Back then I had no idea about real traffic. Little did I know you would grow up and move out to the old Air Force base and change your name.  You silly thing, you moved out there long before the city could accommodate us all with the proper  streets and roads.  Lucky for us the city has worked hard to fix that little problem and access has gotten a great deal better.  I remember flying in and out of Austin and watching the cars and trucks up and down IH35, seeing the beautiful Texas State Capitol and the UT Tower and Football Field. Now when we fly in we get to admire all those beautiful trailer parks and quarries. They sure are pretty, well kind of.  I noticed last week while visiting that you are going through another growth spurt.  You sure are getting big.  I hope that you can grow a few more security areas to keep the lines moving, they can be terribly long and slow.  By the way, you may want to get better signage concerning exiting the paid parking next to the airport.  It was a little confusing finding the new location of your Exit and Pay Booths. The signage was sparse and not as helpful as it could be.   You sure have gotten bright and airy. You offer up a variety of food options, drinks, live music, Wifi, and you keep the place so nice and clean. The vast majority of airport employee's are Austin Friendly and helpful.  I noticed that the wait time for luggage was down the past several times we have been in and out. Even our oversized luggage showed up pretty fast, please do not change that. The last thing a weary traveler wants to do is stand around waiting for luggage. All in all you have grown into a nice respectable airport. I can't pretend I don't miss the old days of flying in to the UT Tower glowing burnt orange or viewing our Pink Granite Capitol from above but you sure are pretty. I will be visiting you again next week and though I dread the commute I look forward to your convenient and affordable parking, professional and friendly staff, a quick Tex Mex meal before I head north and great live music to serenade me off.",Before
296," Very nice airport. Modern, clean, and tons of electrical outlets to plug your devices in. Lots of restaurants, a Book People, and a live band playing! Bathrooms were very clean. This is one of the best airports I have seen.",Before
297," No chains, lots of cool local businesses, friendly Texans, and quick TSA checkpoints. Can't really ask for more.",Before
298, Usually more expensive than the Austin Hazardous Waste drop off location but they have 4 pumps and its covered.,Before
299," Great airport - always clean, not horrible waits, and a decent array of shops and ""snacky poos"" while you waiting for your flight. They also have a great area in the center of the airport where they have daily live music, a nice sized bar and taqueria.  A def plus for any frequent traveler.",Before
300," They need more bars in this bar....errr airport....And why aren't there any maps that point out where the bars are?  It's like a big secret.  What the hell?  I've been flying in and out of Austin since the 1900s and never had a flight delayed.  Guess the good times had to stop eventually.  $40 to upgrade your boarding pass on Southwest.  I said, ""no thanks"" and the guy said, ""how much did you think it cost?""  ""Well, I thought it was complimentary.""  Did Southwest stop doing profit sharing or stock sharing or whatever with their employees?  Was really surprised by the counter person's flippant and slightly condescending tone.  Did he not notice how awesome my hair looked?I finally found a map but it didn't list all the things and I mentioned it to the woman also looking at the map. She clicked an icon and the map lit up. I clicked the cocktails icon and the three bars lit up. I slapped her on the shoulder and said, ""you're so smart!  Earl Campbell's here I come!""  I love how everyone assumes you're a lush because you want to drink before your flight.  Oh, yes, I forgot, the only acceptable airport pastime is staring at your electronic device with furrowed brows, headphones in, and audibly sighing anytime another delay is announced.  The nice thing about airport bars is people actually talk to each other, and someone may even buy someone a drink all super causal and suave.  And they let us put on The Walking Dead.Why are the arrival and departure boards so small? Are they getting smaller?  Neither of the two bars I went to had the departures boards in the bar, so it was a combination of squinting at the across the aisle and hoping the Google card on my phone was accurate.  That's all I need, to miss a flight cause I was drinking $9 vodka sodas in an airport sports bar and couldn't read the 8 point font on the departure monitor 50 feet away.  America is aging, when are they going to make signs bigger already?Seriously, a few sad ""airport"" versions of iconic Austin restaurants and three bars, almost zero services (where was the shoe shine person? That's half the reason I even go to the airport; is there a salon here?  come on now).  Sure it's pretty but it still feels all Gotham City with the mostly very dark gray on gray motif, an international airport where you can only go to Mexico and still have to go through Houston for a passport check.  Meh.  Two stars for the mehrport, plus one for the TSA agents who are always flirty.  Every time.  Without fail.  This last time, the guy said he could see my smile on the full body scan.  Oh there were so many inappropriate things I could have said to that.  But I just smiled instead...",Before
0, This airport is pretty similar to other airports in the nation but with that cool and trendy Austin feel. They just recently remodeled areas of the airport and are still undergoing projects to better the place. They have so many amazing food options that are local to the Austin area and the souvenir shops in the airport are wonderful with many things to choose from. When I travel the TSA line typically is not long of a wait at all and navigation thru the airport is very detailed and simple to understand. Plenty of parking nearby and fairly easy to navigate getting to and from this airport.,During
1, It used to be SO convenient. Easy and stress less. Leave it to Austin to take what was convenient and working since the beginning and totally F it up. Ride share pick up is now a VERY VERY VERY long walk away. You may as well park your car and shuttle in. Thank you Austin for giving one more reason to move after 30 years.,During
2, I come here every year for F1. I love this airport because it's very different and they have a huge variety of food and vending machines! TSA lines move fast and it's a very easy to access airport. I love how the rental car lot is very visible from the terminal. One of my favorite airports in America! There's never a line or a packed airport.,During
3, This airport was clean and the TSA were super friendly and helpful. I was through security and at my gate in less than 10 minutes. Super efficient. Thanks Austin!,During
4," I found the airport clean, full of restaurants and helpful people.  Easy drop off and pick up at the terminalDeparting  and leavening from the gates are easy as well.Always a good experience .",During
5," Early morning airport, heading home but I'm starving- hope to find something good!Smaller airport but very busy at 5am. Lighting and signage is excellent. The TSA pre area was super fast, almost zero weight. As expected with pre I was able to keep my shoes  belt on and pass through with no delay. Friendly TSA folks (especially since it was so early) and all lines flowed very fast. Gate 26 offered a spacious waiting area with ample seating and charging outlets.Thanks all!",During
6, Always a 20 plus minute wait for bags to start coming out once you have walked to baggage claim. Such terrible customer service! Is it a surprise that the planes are landing?,During
7," Shocked at the lack of sit down restaurants.  Even the ""food court"" was salads and smoothies and beer. Live music was cool but not the best place to spend a long layover.",During
8," This airport was a treat to spend time in. It's clean, updated, with easy-to-follow signage. Check-in and security was easy enough and fairly average for early morning airport times. The terminal I was in was super fresh and seemed to have plenty of better-than-usual dining options. It was morning when I was there, so I opted for breakfast. However, there were two good breakfast/coffee options right by our gate. And while one has a super long line, the other was speedy and ready to serve! Unfortunately the night I flew in there was some kind of sewer issue, so walking outside was quite smelly. The whole area smelled like a farm, but I understand that's not normal. I will say the only bad part of the experience was how hard it was to find the ride share area. It was like a MAZE to get there.",During
9," The airport has done a great job in updating parking, services, and gates over time. There are multiple security points to enter depending on your airline. This can really save you some time. The airport also has multiple pre-check and clear entry points which makes security a breeze. A small suggestion for improvement would be to add a priority pass lounge.",During
15," As an Austin native, I always think about how our airport serves as a first impression to visitors of this great city. In my biased opinion, I still feel that our airport is one of the better airports in the nation.Is it large? Not really. Clean? Yes. Homey? I'd think so. Food good? It's okay (used to be better with more local austin joints like Scholotzky's and Amy's). Now it's filled with generic overpriced basic hipster places. Service and TSA good? Mostly decent. Easy to navigate? Yes. In the end, I still feel at home everytime I fly back. I hope you do too. Welcome to Austin.",During
16," Horrible airport. Too busy and crowded with very little direct flights.Narrow walking hall, long hall with one exit to outside terminal. Austin being  a major city, very busy city with too many festivals and events, the city needs to expand its poor airport. They need more flights, more seats at the airport  for travelers to sit on, more entrances and exits. The travelers drop off and pick up areas are horrible, crowded all the time even at 3 am, disorganized, taxis and Uber are all the way in some garage. They keep adding poor unneeded shops and restaurants instead of gates and flights and bigger area for people to walk in the airport instead of running into each other due to lack or space. Ridiculous",During
17, I travel weekly and this airport is quick. TSA is great. Lots of local food spots here as well. American executive lounge is nice. There's also a shoe shine spot.,During
18," Nice small airport (compared to ATL anyway), shirt security lines, easy check in, and gates very short walk away. Could do with more variety of shops and food options.",During
19," This airport feels kinda small compared to JFK and other places that I have been to. However, it seems much cleaner and more organized than LGA, JFK, and others...",During
20," Great food, easy layout, friendly workers, HORRIBLE signage for ground/ride share transportation. Would rather go through a corn maze blindfolded in the dark than trust their signage.",During
21, They change where you can get a share ride so now you walk a half a mile in the cold and rainy weather in the middle of a parking garage? Not very functional and confusing setup.,During
22," I was struck by how much Austin's airport reminded me of the San Jose airport in California. But then I realized they both cater to the same customers, as well as having the benefit of having the space to be modernized. Unlike older airports they have an open terminal plan so there's more space, more options for passing time when your flight is delayed. It is a bit of a trek to the rideshare pickup but that may be due to a common theme at every airport A.U.C. (Always Under Construction) It was nice enough to make a three hour flight there for a two hour meeting and a turnaround three hour flight home less painful.",During
23," This is was my second time here At this airport is not what I expected. It's very small and they always have some type of construction going on, the restroom are always dirty. I had forgot the first time never to use them and unfortunately, I had to go with my second visit and the restroom were even worse!! The TSA team is so rude always yelling at everyone customer service is even worse. I'd rather drive to Austin then fly with this type of service.",During
24," As far as airports go, this one is great. Simple layout, local food options, and quick service all help you fly comfortably. I've used the cell phone lot several times so I don't have to circle forever. I have never lost luggage on my way out of this airport.",During
30, I'm disappointed with the new rideshare pick up location in the second parking garage. Why do you dislike us so much? Totally lame. Guess I'm going to opt to get a ride from family moving forward.,During
31," Love this airport. Active, artsy, friendly, perfect sizeFeels comfy and invitingStaff, even cleaning staff in restrooms are helpful and pleasant Like the way you don't need to take a shuttle to rent a Car, although it is a long walk if you can't make it, have someone else come get you when all is said and doneWish the food offerings were not stuck in Texas clog your arteries mode. Hard to find much variety, lots of Mexican food choices Surrounding hotels have gotten so expensive now, so caution. Not your usual Cheap Texas discount anymore. Austin has grown popular, the secret is out.",During
32, Really really nice airport for a small airport. It reminds me of Dallas Love Field which is equally nice!,During
33, Revised cell phone lot absolutely SUCKS. Spaces reduced drastically. Narrow lanes for traffic. Corners are way too tight. Have witnessed several almost wrecks due to design.  What on earth were the planners thinking??!!??!!  Or drinking? Clearly they could care less about helping travelers and those who meet them. I use to love this airport. Now I hate it. This change is not even close to being an improvement. Bad. Bad. Bad. Stay away if you have a choice.,During
34," Been flying in and out of this airport for over 6 years.  It's a small airport but it sure is efficient! Great cell phon waiting lot is awesome, with a nice new 24-he Texaco gas station,  soon to be subway and Austin java shop if you are waiting for arriving guests.",During
35, Nice airport you can purchase last minute they have a big variety of food. You can enjoy yourself at one of the local bar taverns there while you wait. If you forget your charger or anything like that you can definitely pick it up there at one of the local shops.,During
36," I did not get to see much of Austin's airport as my arrival was at 11:30 PM and my departure a few days later was at 5:30 AM. Well, that's not entirely true. I got to see quite a lot of the hike between the gates and the rental car center.There are not many concessions open that late or that early, so I can't tell you much about their food or the shopping amenities. The wifi was free and it worked well, so that's a plus.If I ever return to Austin, maybe Delta will have a Sky Club and the airport will be done with the construction with some sort of people mover to the rental cars.[Review 10194 overall, 1780 of 2018.]",During
37, Some of the friendliest staff I have met at an airport. Stopped here for a 5pm flight- not too busy easy to come through with security. Overall bathrooms are neat and tidy. Lots of food choices as well. Typical airport prices when it comes to the meals. Pleasant airport experience,During
38," The airport is under renovation.  While we sat and waited to board our plane it sounded like someone was going to tunnel thru the ceiling onto our heads!!!  Besides that it's a simple airport to navigate, inside and out.  Pick up, drop off, really simple.  One long concourse so nothing confusing to navigate.  Security checkpoint moved fast and efficient.",During
39, TSA is awful. Rude condescending and slow. I was pre checked but had to go thru pat down because of an articulate hip. I told them I had it showed them my card. Too bad. Then I had to wait and wait on a woman to do the job. I only fly out of here because it's the only close airport with non stop to Lubbock. Oh for the day. SA gets a flight. SA is much better and I may start going thru there even if it is slower and has a stop.,During
45, Horrendous beyond words!!!  I had to take a taxi because cell phone coverage is so bad at the ride app pickup.  The walk is the equivalent of 2-3 blocks hauling all your luggage in the elements. How can you do this to us!?! This is shameful.,During
46, Cluster! Punished for using Uber and Lyft. Be prepared to go the distance with your luggage... across the street and up a level where cell phone coverage is spotty. Absolute worst I have ever experienced anywhere. If you have back problems be prepared to consult with an attorney...,During
47, Great sized airport. Easy to navigate through. Found my gate with no problems. It was my first time in this airport and definitely will use it again when I come visit!,During
48, AUS is one of my favorite airports​! I'm not just saying that because I live here. AUS has added so many local favorite restaurants right in the airport. I also like that a lot of the restaurants aren't super expensive like some airports I've been to in the states. The staff at the airport are always very thorough​ when I go through check-in​. The only con to this airport is that there isn't a Priority Pass lounge which is kinda annoying for how busy the airport is. Other than that it's great!,During
49, Small airport that's easy to get around yet big enough to go to major hubs. Prices aren't too bad. Only real issue is location of cabs and Ubers is a bit of a hike.,During
50, Everything's bigger in Texas!! This is a very smooth process from check-in to departure. This airport offers a variety of places to eat and grab a quick drink. The food is not as expensive as you would expect in the JFK airport and the ceiling was very comfortable,During
51, Austin airport is efficient and effective in the flow of traffic.  The airport has plenty of options for food and places to sit while waiting for your flight.  They also offer free WiFi!  Always a big plus.  When you walk out of the airport you walk through the parking lot to get to the car rental terminal.  Everything is clearly labeled throughout the airport to help you navigate your way through.  They are sill doing some construction to the place.,During
52," I am no world traveler by any means but I have been to my fair share of airports. I would say AUS is above average. A quick 2.5 hour flight from Atlanta was great for a long weekend/bachelor party getaway. We did not have much experience flying in as we got there, got our rental, and left. My main experience with this airport was on our flight out. The rental return and shuttle from the the rental center was quick and easy. I was expecting a long line to get through security/TSA but it was very fast and efficient. We got to the airport fairly early so we had some time to burn. Everybody was pretty hungry as we had not had breakfast yet. The problem was not finding something to eat, it was choosing WHICH place to eat. I swear I walked up and down the terminal 4 times before I decided on something to eat. I went with a smoothie of some sort which was great because I was trying to detox from the weekend. I did see a 2 different smoothie places, sandwiches, and Salt Lick BBQ in the terminal.",During
53," I really like this airport overall. The parking can be a bit confusing, the first time but once you get inside, there's a fun and exciting atmosphere, the staff gets you through the lines quickly and while it's a big airport, it's small enough that you don't have to run to catch your flight.",During
54," I enjoy flying into this airport a lot.  They have a good amount of inbound/outbound flights, and the airport itself is very easy to navigate.It's in a great location in relation to the city, and just minutes away.  Rental car service is fantastic, it's literally a walk across the departures and you're set to go.There is a fantastic variety of restaurants and cafes inside the airport which is awesome for its size --I've seen much larger airports with fewer amenities.The security lines and checkpoints flow great and never have a long wait; they're very efficient.  Overall it's always a fantastic experience when flying in and out of this airport.",During
55, What on earth were they thinking with the new taxi/ride share area? Way too far from terminal and not efficient. See my previous review...continual disappointment.,During
56," Security at checkpoint 1 this morning was a hot mess and every single one of them was rude. The premium passenger lane was blocked off and I was told I could get into the lane once i walked through this giant line with general boarding. As a business traveler, I specifically buy business class to avoid a line. What bothered me most is that people who are ""clear"" members for $160 a year got to go straight through their lane. I'm sorry but i pay more than $160 on one flight to have a  business class Ticket,wtf?",During
57, I fly in and out of this airport atleast twice a week. Very easy airport to navigate and TSA Pre/cleared programs make security very easy. I like that all of the reataurants/shops behind security are all locally owned. The live music in the afternoons makes it an even better experience.,During
63, With only local businesses selling food it's overpriced and you can't get a cheap burger from McDonald's or something. What is the worst is to leave the airport you have to walk two city blocks and up to the second floor to catch your cab or rideshare you cannot catch it out front anymore. Totally stupid! No Christmas decorations I guess they don't want to offend anyone but they do have giant guitars here even though it's not the live music capital of the world anymore since most musicians can't afford the rent.,During
64," We just arrived from Denver,Colorado and we are shocked by what the city of Austin has done to the taxi drivers and travelers!!!! They moved the taxi stand to underneath the parking garage!!! It's raining and we had to cross from the terminal, load our luggage on a golf cart like shuttle  and shuttle over to the new taxi stand under there... the driver said there is no cell service in the garage so, he is having trouble finding his fares and no gps...They can't help people with their luggage coming out of the airport.  Also, they have the emerging taxis moving into the traffic moving at 40mph. This is unacceptable and please let the city know that they need to change the taxi stand back to where it has always been!!! It's just awful what they have done!!!",During
65," Super easy check in process, TSA-precheck, live music in the bars/restaurants adding more bars, adding more food, smaller regional feel compared to large airports across the country are a number of things I would say as perks. The only drawback I would say is the construction as they are rapidly expanding. But I mean they are growing so how much of a drawback can this be. It happens everywhere and its a necessity. Always love flying in and out of Austin's airport as its quick and easy. No need (in my opinion) to get here 2 hours ahead of time. Unless you really like The Salt Lick (which is delicious) or you like to have a few cocktails before take off and people watch. I'll be back through next month! Justin",During
66, This airport has the worst food selection.  They only have bbq and one Italian place at the other end you had better eat before you go.  Especially if you are running late you are screwed as the lines for the small food selection are so long.  Even to just buy a water you have a ten minute wait.  Austin International airport is a joke!,During
67," I have to agree with Amanda K. On this one. We travel in and out of AIBA regularly and we are discovering that the amount of traffic, the sheer number of people, and the airports lack of infrastructure to handle the growth. They are building more parking garages but no more lanes to accommodate the cars dropping people off. We park in the long term parking lots and when we are picked up it can be difficult to communicate with the drivers some times. I get that Austin is growing. I get that we need to embrace the change and growth. I understand that it is happening faster than some things can be done but It's my opinion that it needs to be addressed sooner than later.On a very positive note: The restaurants and places to shop are improving. We have had several really good meals from some of Austin's top restaurants. Security lines in most American airports are a joke and AIBA isn't any different but that there are two security gates is helpful. Maybe they could put signs (like Burma Shave signs from decades ago) reminding people what they will be asked to do when they get to the check points.",During
68, It is getting more and more difficult to drop off or pick up people. Soon rideshares won't be allowed in the zone by the terminal. The garage allows 1 hour of free parking if you can find a spot. Might be a better place to pick up your peeps.,During
69," Austin is such a cool airport. Plenty of places to sit and eat, have a beer, and even listen to live music. I like how efficient it is. We have an admiral's club, TSA precheck, Clear at two checkpoints, and even an international terminal! If you pay attention, there are cases throughout with rotating local art displays. That is one of my favorite things when I come home, strolling through and looking at the latest interesting displays. This is my favorite airport, and lucky for me, I live here!",During

71, Love the expansion and improvements on the food selections. Having dining options like The Peached Tortilla and getting you're Dr. Doctor shots at JuiceLand before a flight really brings in some of the Austin experience. The shops are always stocked with all the wacky and fun souvenirs that Austin is so well know for. The staff is always helpful when you need assistance and the whole airport is extremely clean.,During
72, Absolutely horrible wheelchair service. My wife had to wait over 20 mins standing in pain due to the incredible incompetence  indifference at this airport. We live in Austin. This is shameful.,During
73," There was some construction as I was passing through here, but it's still quite nice. Pick up area is nutso, even past midnight, FYI.",During
74," Not high up on my list of favorite airports. It's decent, with a few shopping and food options to choose from, but no Priority lounges and the food is more like food court options instead of sit down restaurants. At least everything is clean and easy to get around in .",During
80," We sat in the car rental return line for 45 min only to be told by a construction worker to leave it on the side of the road. There was not a sign, not an explanation just too bad so sad. Lugging luggage up ramps was anything but fun. Typical airport...lousy service and no interest in their customer.",During
81, AUS is a terrific airport. Easy to get in and out is something I really appreciate as a travel enthusiast. This airport is not very big so that helps the cause. Facilities and amenities were wonderful. Live music throughout was very welcoming as the music capital of the world. This airport hosts a Salt Lick BBQ location which is absolutely delicious. Vino Volo is another favorite -- wine bar at the airport? I'm game! Sit and relax before your flight boards is my type of ambiance. Admirals and United club are available. No centurion lounge or priority pass avail (other than the suites). Bag claim and ground transport is easy. Follow signs and you'll be ok. Bidding y'all passing through AUS a safe travel to/from home.,During
82, I was very happy with his airport. It was well laid out and there were plenty of bathrooms and locations where I could fill water. They were all large variety of restaurants and shops. They were also plenty of re-charge locations for my electronics. The staff was very helpful and I did not have any problems with traveling through this airport.,During
83," I love small airports. I know this airport isn't that tiny, but it's a lot smaller than the airports I'm most familiar with (like DFW, SFO, LAX), and so I find it refreshing. There's plenty of food and drink options, but nothing overwhelming or super impressive. The line at security was pretty short on a Tuesday morning, and I found most of the spaces I visited to be clean - restrooms, waiting areas, cafes and gift shops I got here earlier than planned the other day and found myself very comfortable grabbing a drink and snack and settling down to work for a few hours.",During
84," Reviews of an Austin adventure clearly begin here - and the airport did a fine job of welcoming us into the food filled, pun ready, tourist prepared, backyard charm that it is. Plus a star for being easily navigatable in terms of finding your way out of the airport and off to the fun, specifically the bus stop doubling as a big guitar that is a real easy spot with a straight line downtown. Another for the jumble of food and drink options that make sitting at the airport feel like part of the party. There was also a fancy coffee robot looking vending machine that gave you coupons for a transport ride, which was nifty. Enough eats and looks that I almost forgot the confuzzled mess that was our departure when they had at least 5 flights departing around the same time in an area that clearly was supposed to house two. The crowd was massive and mixed around, with three times as many people as seats. The lines for certain flights were physically blocking the ability for other flights from boarding - maybe that was the issue? Who knows, nobody told us. We waited as absolutely nothing was said about our flight on the speaker or updated anywhere past our boarding time, past our take off time, until finally the screen just switched to the NEXT flight taking off to another city. Luckily this resulted in a collective confusion, realization that we were all still waiting in a walkaway heading the same way so obviously the flight was still there, then eventually they asked us to board as if nothing had happened. We could blame that one on the airline, I think the mash-up of flights in that corner could also be a factor. There were tables that seemed to be thrown in that you could stand by, yet also blocked walkways. Whelp, whatever, we got where we got and made some new friends hanging around the tables. The art and eat options made the whole thing feel more entertaining despite the crowds and awkward spacing that took away the flow of foot traffic - so a-okay in my book.",During
85," Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is a pretty nice airport for Austin.  Nice airport overall, not a typical airport with franchise chains but  Austin-Bergstrom International Airport has unique restaurants, coffee shops and bars unique to Austin. The cons: not enough parking at the airport, narrow terminals, OK prices for the restaurants / bars / shops, most of the restaurants 7 bars are not open past 8:30pm, hard to find car rental system and for the time being the airport is a mess due to construction upgrades.  All in all Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is a nice airport with potential.",During
86, I love this airport but HATE the parking and signs.  They are terrible communicators on transitioning and moving around the chaos they call parking lots and garages.,During
87," This used to be my favorite airport. It might be among my top 3 again in the future,  but right now it's too chaotic a scene to be anything other than just another transit point.  Its undergoing construction. Hard to hold that against them as they are clearly trying to meet the needs of a vastly increased flow of travelers from when this was first built. But it makes everything noisy and cramped in the meantime. The corridor to the gates should be wide and unimpeded. Instead it's full of tables, reducing the space for walking to exactly one person wide.  And the trek to the car rental counters, outside up and across, is poorly indicated and frankly an unwelcome hike after a long flight. Positive notes include above average friendliness and efficiency from TSA, at least in the precheck line, and a great variety of food and coffees. Crowded, though. I look forward to returning and finding improvements.",During
88," What I love, they have Salt Lick BBQ express (bbq and taco stand), live music, and easy to navigate. What I look forward to, a little train that will take my bags and I down the corridor :)Easy to navigate, clean, and the nicest people around, it's always fun to fly into Austin and be greeted with friendly ""Welcome to Austin"", great tacos, and a bright terminal. I think I also had the fastest check in on a Monday morning ever. Got to the line and was welcomed to the TSA precheck because there was no line. Zipped through security because officers were super efficient, and made it all through within 3 minutes. This may have been a fluke but hey, I'll take it. Keep Austin Airport weird but keep up the great work.",During
89," I've been traveling back and forth to Austin for work almost every week for the past year. I appreciate that the airport is smaller and very easy to get in and out of. Also, The Austin airport offers access to Clear and TSA Precheck which makes the road warrior life a lot easier!There are a few restaurants outside of security but I'm always in a rush to catch my flights so I've never eaten outside of security. There are a number of options inside include Salt Lick BBQ, Maudie's Tex Mex and Amy's Ice Cream. If you were in Austin and didn't get a chance to Amy's Ice Cream, I would recommend to grab a cone. It's so good!There are two lounges (United and AA) located upstairs near gate 22. I hear that they are also getting a Delta Sky Lounge at the end of this year or the beginning of 2019.",During
95," This airport is kinda small. But the one thing the pet sitter asked for in Austin was Live Oak cans. The airport did deliver on that, post TSA, so I didn't have to check my bag. Both the Hops and Hippies(?...I might have the name wrong) and Salt Lick areas had crowlers to go. The Hops and Hippies tap area had 6 packs too which was nice. The crowler machine at HH was busted the day I was there though. Other amenities: a coffee machine that seemed somewhat fancy ($4 lattes), a Schlotsky's (we don't have those in Oregon but man their bread is good!) and a nice Italian bar with white quartz everywhere. I wish there was a lounge for Priority Pass but overall it's a good airport, not too much of a shitshow like some places (LAX...). Big clean bathrooms. Not that big if you feel stir crazy and want to pace the lengths of the terminal. I don't think there are any moving sidewalks either. We boarded late by about 10 min for a connection to Houston but the flight only took 30 min (scheduled to take an hour) so I think we made up the time.",During
96," This is a lot like my home airport - not too big, easy to navigate, and plenty of places to pass the time.  Security was easy to go through, and everyone, even the TSA folks, were friendly.  That being said, it was 6:30 in the morning, so it wasn't too busy.",During
97," Efficient  friendly - that counts for a lot with TSA, haha. Never takes more than an hour between arriving  being ready to board!",During
98, Decent AirportPros:+ Lots of great restaurants+ Easy to park+ Quick securityCons:- Restaurants do close early- Quality of food is absolutely awful here- Few connections,During
99," I pick up and drop off passengers at this airport all the time in the last 3 years I have gotten many complaints from my passengers who have said that the employees at this airport are very rude and I've seen the employees be rude to Rideshare drivers but cater to the taxi cabs. City officials in this city need to realize that the people of the city do not want the Cab's here they want the rideshare, because taxi cabs rip people off of course so does this city.",During
100," Super easy airport that isn't too crowded.  We flew out of AUS and it was super easy.  We dropped off our rental car with Enterprise at an adjacent parking lot, which made the trip very easy.  You drop off your car, take an elevator down and then walk over to the terminals.  The process was simple and fast.  We got through TSA within minutes - the lines are nothing like the ones at LAX. When you enter the airport, it's full of local businesses, which is so nice.  They also have tons of places to eat: FARA Coffee, SOCO Market, Ruta Maya Coffee, Fig + Plum, Seco2d Bar, Juiceland, Peached Tortilla, Hippies  Hops, Berry Austin, Briggo, Salt Lick, Amy's Ice Cream, Plane box Food, Maudies, Schlotzsky's...the list goes on.  They also offer live music.  Tons of art and shopping as well.",During
101," We moved to Austin about 3 years ago and when I got off the plane, to house hunt, there was a band playing at the bar and the energy of the airport was just fun!!! There have been some major improvements over the last couple months so there are new, nice restaurants and stores every 25 feet. 4 stars is bc, lately, baggage claim has taken longer than it did a year ago. I used to brag to people that I could get my bags in 10 minutes but this weekend my bag took over 30 minutes. This is unacceptable for such a small airport.",During
102," Very beautiful and clean, so much shopping and eating choices!!! All employees are courteous!!!",During
103," It isn't perfect, but ABI has continued to improve in the way of organization and amenities, and it stands out to me especially when I visit airports in other cities. I like the way auto lanes are organized and give clear directions to direct traffic to lots (including the cell phone lot, where you can wait for your arriving passengers to text you for pick up). Drivers can be rude at the terminal pick up drop off area, so make sure to watch for cars changing lanes at the last minute while pedestrians are crossing the street to the parking lots. The menu once inside is extensive and includes limited versions of local fare and slightly inflated prices. TSA is TSA. What can I say except that the invasive and pushy screening process is the most stressful part of travel for me, and why I don't do it more often. That's one thing that our airport seems to overkill. You are a potential criminal here until proven otherwise. Try to check in online or take advantage of whatever conveniences or travel perks your airline offers. Staff are generally friendly and helpful but this airport is always busy, even when the city seems to be asleep. Plan ahead and allow for plenty of extra time. Two hours before flight time is not an exaggeration.",During
104," Where most airports are the same, ABIA is much different from the rest.  The City of Austin promotes local businesses to fill the food, drink, and merchandise vendors.  It makes it more unique and better.  The parking options are great and most lots are reasonably close to the terminals. Checking in and security is pretty much the same here as with other airports.  All the gates are basically located on one long wing except the few in the south terminal. However it will change in the future with the number of gates to double.  Outside will find dedicated pickup locations for taxis, ride sharing, and buses. There is a special free waiting area called cell phone lot for those waiting on someone to arrive and pick them up.But for right now you will experience a nice variety of options while you wait like a new wine and snack bar.  There are drawbacks like no free WiFi or areas to work while devices plugged in. However the food options are quite good and never had a bad meal there.  If you forgot to eat at your favorite Austin restaurant then most likely will find it here. I even chatted with a passenger who specifically was bringing food back home only found in Austin to their daughter.  Luckily it was a short flight to Houston. You will find many direct flights where this airport is growing including new direct domestic and international flights. Baggage claim has improved and like any other airport sometimes you either wait forever or bags show up quickly. Leaving the airport is easy since there is a highway right next to it and downtown not to far away.",During
110, A straight forward operation...You land you get out and stretch your legs.The gates are really to get to and maybe it's just me but I like the fact once you clear the airport security you are already at the gates. There's actually a lot of eateries but unfortunately this was a layover so we really didn't have time to try the salt lick bbq.I did get a chance to get a cup of mocha made by a robot.No nonsense airport and I will need to come back so that I can explore a lot more with time permitting.,During
111," Lots of good restaurants here! It's a clean, modern terminal, and definitely not an austere place. Cozy yet good size.It's outside of the city, but very easy to get to: 183 South! SimpleParking - plentiful -and rental cars are just across the drive from the terminal. While you wouldn't want to be stuck here for more than a couple hours, it's a nice airport!",During
112," Friendly helpful staff made my return back to Texas after a vacation in Europe great! Special thanks to Jason at ""lost and found""  for getting my passport back to me. P.s really appreciated speaking to a ""human"" while calling the airport - no automated answering system.",During
113," Artwork everywhere! Just watch where you're going and don't run over toddlers with your roller luggage! This is a smooth functioning airport. The signs are clear and if you've been here a few times it's easy to remember your direction. They're still doing some improvements, but it still looks great! I'm liking the futuristic blimps guys! Best thing yet I've spotted was a saxophone converted to an inconspicuous cellphone holder :D quite crafty don't ya' think? That artist has an awesome mind.Have not had any problems with departing and arriving airlines either. Transportation pick-ups including Lyft are all in one area - same route without confusing designation areas.",During
114, Extremely small airport especially for all of the travelers going in and out of here. Unfortunately car rental is not very well marked and semi hard to find. I had to ask a lot of people how to get there. Not a lot of restaurant choices but a fair amount especially considering the size of the airport. One good thing about the size it's easy to get to the gates.,During
115," I like the airport as a traveler coming in to visit.  The rental cars have easy access to the terminals.  The main problem with the airport, as I see it, are the dining options.  Everything is fast food, decent fast food but fast food.  I fly from California where Oakland, San Jose  Phoenix airports have actual restaurants that serve great food and are inside the terminal.  Each of the aforementioned airport restaurants serve great food all day (Joe's San Jose) and have good coffee.  We had ""breakfast"" at Earl Campbell's Austin on Sept 8th 2018, yuck!  The food was less than average, the coffee tasted like weak tea.  Their sister ""restaurant  had the same coffee however a barista that was very understanding and accommodating assisted me.  My wrap up is, if you want easy access to the airport and rental cars 100% Austin Airport.  If you want to sit down and have a beer or wine, there's a seat for you.  If you'd like fast food, this is the place.  If you want a meal and good coffee (like Phoenix, San Jose and Oakland) absolutely do not expect this from the Austin Airport.",During
116," This is truly a great airport!First of all, it's one terminal. This helps if you want to wait with friends, connect to a flight, or meet with friends coming in from different flights. It also means schlepping your bags since there are no moving walkways. TSA here is fast. I have pre-check but they digitally list the wait time for the regular line and it was an average of 3-4 mins. My only issue (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that only 2 of the 3 checkpoints has a TSA pre-check line. The closest one to JetBlue does not have pre-check so you have to walk over to the AA side of the check-in terminal.Other than that, everything here is fast and snappy. Plenty of GOOD food options. Tons of seating. A few charging stations. Tons of light. Live music in some of the food areas. Music playing throughout the terminal regardless if it's live or not. Bright signs to show you where to go. Overall, it's just a beautiful airport.The one suggestion would be to add an Uber/Lyft waiting spot. As of now both services are encouraged to use the general pick-up area which causes a ton of congestion. I know car services are new to the Austin area but it's something to consider.",During
117," The airport itself is fine. There are plenty of restaurants you can eat at and it's pretty clean inside, but it's a small airport so you'll have to have your ride wait in a cell lot and drive up to get you. The real bummer was the TSA which was a nightmare. Not only do they make you take out even food at the X-ray machine, but they don't have enough bins for your stuff and after being leered at you'll get the special 2 minute pat down because zippers on pants set off their walk in scanner. Definitely not a fan of that.",During
118," The employees are very friendly just like what I experienced in the city of Austin Texas. It's kinda small however Austin's airport is pretty easy to navigate. Austin airport delivers in terms of the character and charm of the city. It offers lots of good barbeque spots to eat such as salt lick BBQ. It also has live music and Austin is known for being a music based city, basically you cant maneuver around the airport without seeing a live band at a restaurant shop or someone in the corner playing music from their guitar.Baggage check in was pretty smooth, it's clean and not too crowded!",During
119, I like the Austin airport. It's clean and spacious offering different types of restaurants. Customer service is friendly and there's always a place to sit.,During
125," This was my first trip from Austin to Vegas and back so I have never been on a plane (Frontier Airlines) which I was anxious for sure as I tend to get anxiety rather easily. When we arrived there was no wait to check in our bag and hardly anyone waiting to go through security so it was smooth sailing. The problem that ended up happening was our plane was a few hours late because of bad weather conditions from the previous destination. Which I figured ok that can happen but when the plane got there they continued to make us wait even after refueling because the pilots were about to go over their flying time. So we almost had our flight canceled but somehow they made it all work out. It was very stressful waiting to find out what they were gonna do and hearing everyone complain about it; once on the plane it went pretty fast and the rest was a great flight. Overall, not too bad of an experience.",During
126, Very Austin based airport. All the yummy Austin foods ready to be eaten once you land when you've been far from home!,During
127," I like Austin Airport. It's kind of funny how much they really want you to know you're in Texas as soon as you land. Just has its own type of charm I suppose. As far as the facility itself I've only ever flown between this location and Charlotte Douglas in NC, so my view is a little narrow. That being said no big complaints. Sure its a smaller facility than CLT, but that's not really an issue. They could use a few more ""normal"" places to grab a bite to eat, but you won't starve. No problems getting through security or boarding on our trip. Plenty of seating in the terminal (except for the San Francisco gate, it was kind of weird). The few airport employees I interacted with seemed nice enough and there were no delays.Nothing super exciting, but no problems either. It's an airport!",During
128," This airport is easy to navigate if you are departing from Austin. However, if you are arriving identifying the exit to baggage claim can be difficult especially if you have not been there before. The exit signs are not in obvious places abs are rather small and are located above head level. There are quite a few charging stations located throughout. The layout follows a straight row and number pattern. The seating is open and spacious, which is refreshing considering some airports I have been in. There are three TSP entry points, so if the line is rather long where you are located.....chances are that the other lines are empty.",During
129," Beware south terminal shuttle. SIX employee lot buses have come and gone over 30 minutes--no shuttle for customers yet! Pitiful.UPDATE:  A total of 28 buses run by the service who provides a shuttle to the south terminal--ABIA--came and went for employee lots and long-term term lots before a shuttle arrived for the south terminal. One bus labeled ""South Terminal"" pulled up, empty, we all stood up--the driver slowed to a stop, waved us away, and left!!! Waited about ONE HOUR for the shuttle. Worse than pitiful.",During
130," I've flown all over the U.S. Austin-Bergstrom is easily amongst the best! The facility is easily reached via freeway and tollway. The ONLY negative is the limited parking in the lot, forcing customers to use the very expensive garage. Once inside the airport, finding your way around is a breeze. A major advantage is that it's small. So are the crowds. TSA personnel are unusually friendly and even jocular. Terminals are spacious. Clean. Flights are generally cheaper than those departing from our home airport of San Antonio.",During
131," As with most airports that I visit, I find them nice because they are not like my super crowded home airport of LAX. During my visit in June, I saw that they are doing some renovations in the airport, especially at the gate where Southwest airlines are located.Checking in our bags was easy. However, going through TSA was kind of a hassle. Not to bag on TSA as they are only doing their job to protect travelers, but the lines were going painfully slow. My bag had to go through inspection because I had Buc-ee's beaver nuggets in my duffel bag (maybe I missed it, but I didn't see a sign saying that I had to remove my food from my bag). It was kind of funny when they saw the beaver nuggets, because they said they wish they had some to eat. Another thing was that I saw a guy who totally missed his flight because they were slowly doing some extra inspection on his luggage, but I guess that's partly his fault because he didn't come early. Lesson learned: make sure to always arrive at the airport early!Other than that, my beaver nuggets are okay, I was able refill my water bottle at one of their water stations, and I went back to California safe and sound.",During
132," Typical airport, however I did like the better separation between groups for my United flight to prevent everyone clogging / huddling across groups. If you're a country music fan, you'll immediately notice it playing throughout in addition to potentially a live performer. Not my cup of tea, but I don't judge :)",During
133," It's getting better and bigger! Austin is the most simplest airport no train ride to the gates! Drop off and pick up is horrible....definitely need a better flow or a facilitator. There's unique food places and even a juice land :) however there's no Starbucks ‍ or any retail chains. There's quite a few book stores but no clothing and shoe stores. There's is a small boutique that's newer and local. Austin is growing and the airport is continuing to add on. One other cool thing to note is they have a pod for nursing moms, I thought that was cool.",During
134, Super cool airport.  Tons of eating fresh options.  TSA was super quick.  It was busy for the size of the airport.  What did I learn today?  They have a Salt Lick BBQ in the airport.,During
140," Nice airport with a lot of nice places to eat, except they don't have a McDonald's, which was surprising. They do have a Salt Lick stand where you can get some tacos.",During
141, Love the south terminal. First time flying out of here and it seems very secluded which is fine with me. Tucked in its own corridor. Little farther away but I like it's not crowded at all. Easy in easy out..,During
142," They definitely don't want you to be comfortable here.We unfortunately had to stay overnight midnight-5AM to get to our next flight.*Seating is old standard airport style. *No lights were dimmed between those hours, music is blasting as loud as possible. *It feels like 58 degrees in here, wearing 2 long sleeve shirts, thick pants, fuzzy socks, and a blanket in July--still shivering.*A couple between the ages of 16-18 just had a 1.5 hour dispute/argument--security walked by about 12 times (did nothing) it turned physical (as it was obvious it would) with the girl smacking the boys over-ear headphones off of his head. *They then kissed and made up (really appalling toxic behavior) and proceeded to leave the area--indicating they did not even need to be at this gate in the first place and were just hanging out from 2am-4am. Having a great time, thank you American Airlines for trapping me here.",During
143," Nice airport with new terminals being currently constructed. Many gift shops and restaurant options, Salt Lick BBQ is my favorite. TSA seemed to be somewhat slow, but I haven't seen any better. Overall, nice airport with conveniently located terminals, parking, and well organized.",During
144, Austin International fail.   Waited  30 minutes to open the airplane doors. 10 electronic passport control machines for nearly 500 passengers.  8 work.  Had to stand in line to recheck our bags to our final destination behind all the people that were originating in Austin (we had just flown 11 hrs in from Lisbon.) Other airports do a simple recheck right after customs. TSA very rude and inefficient.  I've NEVER had to separate  carryon snacks for the X-ray at any other airport. Of course our bags didn't make it and the airline won't deliver them since the recheck made them categorized as late. Alaska personnel were fantastic but I will avoid Austin at all costs from now on.,During
145," Austin airport honestly I don't think it would have met my expectations. First time I landed I was quite happy though. The airport is not big or fancy just the right size the city needs. However, austin is growing everyday and it is going to be hard in small space to manage. But you definitely get a cup of coffee here in the morning if you have early morning flight which is great. If you think you have a early morning flight and you can chill and relax and leave for the airport late. You might be wrong ! It is always crowded most of the time. It would be great if you left early just in case you are catching a flight from Austin to somewhere. The restrooms at the airport are clean. WiFi is not so cool but people on airport are generally friendly. Baggage claim is right down on ground level just after you get down the elevator so walking is less. Parking are easy to find and you get Uber taxi or any other cabs easily. OverAll good but not great Happy traveling !",During
146," Very nice airport that is easy in and out. Great selection of airport food and can't go wrong with the Salt Lick barbecue, a must stop everytime I fly in. Also worth checking out the clothes vendors, nice selection, albeit pricy.",During
147, Better than most as far as airports go. Would have earned one more star if the air conditioning were better - Austin TX is hot and summer is a busy travel season - try to anticipate the body heat from the crowds and buy a better cooling system.,During
148, Is an airport. You fly in. You fly out. Delays happen. It's clean. It's organized. What more do you want?,During
149," I've been here many times as I travel often, and although it is not my favorite airport, I have almost never waited past 30 minutes getting through security!It has a selection of restaurants, but not many as it's a smaller airport. Sad knowing I can never get ""good"" coffee because they don't have a Starbucks, just small coffee carts Also very clean!",During
155," I love the airport here! I think it is so cool that all the dining options are local to either Austin or Texas. Go away McDonald's! They have some delicious options too. I'm usually never excited to eat at airports. But here they have The Peached Tortilla- had some awesome tacos (bahn mi!!!) Juiceland- get the wundershozen! And freaking Amy's Ice Creams is here too. Also let's talk about parking, you can park your car here long term for so cheap! And it's managed by the airport itself. Usually other places you have to get an off-site parking spot in order to not get gouged at the airport lot. When they regular lots are full they have overflow parking with clearly parked signs which I really appreciate. The airport is not too massive, a great size to navigate easily. And some really exciting routes offered. For example Norwegian Air flies direct from Austin to London. I also took a direct from Austin to Orlando on Southwest for a great price.",During
156, Very clean and I literally got my bag at baggage claim right when I walked up to the claim area -- nice!  Kids can also play a cool wall game like Pong and an airport this size feeling so comfortable is great!,During
157," I didn't have any issues getting through TSA! In fact, the staff was friendly and they made me giggle a few times as I struggled to get all of my carry on items onto the security belt. I always appreciate that!",During
158," I might as well write a review since I'm a frequent flyer. Overall, the Austin airport is good. Easy in and easy out. I have TSA Pre-check and have never waited more than a few minutes to get through security. They have a lot of food choices for breakfast, lunch or dinner. There are a few nice bar choices and sometimes live music on the stage at the food court area. I haven't been to the new south terminal yet (Frontier is located there) but I hear they have an outdoor sitting area and a food truck. ABIA is unique between the bbq, live music and the ""cool"" vibe. I always know I'm home when I deplane.",During
159," This airport asks you to arrive 2 hours prior to departure time. My flight is now delayed by 2 hours. Not the first, second or third time my flight is super delayed outta here either. So I'll be here for 4 hours. Wasting my time. Security here can take a super long time. It's taken me over an hour before. Today took 8 min. Food options are ok. I'm at the sports bar now and it's full of flies and the customer service sucks. Second is a yummy but expensive restaurant. Thundercloud Subs is wonderful. Not my favorite but not the worst airport.",During
160," Ridiculous line times at all 3 secuity entry points this morning. Get your act together TSB security and staff your areas. Waited an hour to get through, missed my flight and connectors for the first time in 30 years. Adding more flights? Add more throughput!",During
161," Nothing wrong or great with this Airport.  However, I learned this morning that it is SUPER Busy in the early mornings and evenings more so in the summer mornings.  Factor in 30 - 45 minutes to get through security.  Another 20 minutes to check in.  At the least an hour early, probably 90 minutes to be safe",During
162," Airports nice... a lot of options for food and a place to charge your phone. But we had a security guard yell and I mean yell at a group of us at 5 am to go into lines that looked like they were closed down.. no employees, no movement, no buckets. But we were quickly forced over to the metal detectors and told to take nothing out or off.. as my boyfriend made his way through the metal detector went off so they pulled him back and told him to take his keys out of his pocket and place them ON TOP of his backpack (not in a bin) he then was rushed to take his belt and boots off. He went through all good only to have to collect our stuff around other people's items. Long story short his keys are missing and whoops no where to be found? Really? We had to address the way this guy spoke to us and everyone around us because the was that forceful and Rude. Too bad we weren't in a better mind frame to collect our personal items after getting yelled at like on a middle school playground. Now our keys are magically gone and not a single person that works on that ONE EXACT machines knows where they went. Again, shady as hell and now it's time to file a police report. Yay!",During
163, Easy to get into and out of. Small enough to find everything easily. They have enough TSA staff that you don't wait in line forever to check-in.,During
164," Busy little airport that had tremendously out grown itself, but the people are very nice.  Probably the second nicest staff, to PHX.",During
170," I tend to like the smaller airports that are not crazy busy...and this one fits the bill.  It is pretty busy but nothing like LAX or ATL.  For it's size it is fairly busy and the ""people flow"" is not great so there are random clumps of congestion here and there where restaurant lines overflow out into the traffic in the concourse.You can smell the barbeque immediately...and if you are hangry like we were you will go and get some...immediately.Yeah buddy!(felt the need to drop a common Texas phrase somewhere...)",During
171," One of the slowest worst airports in the country, I live in Vegas and Austin is such a beautiful City, the airport needs to catch up to the culture of this amazing city. They also seem to overbook flights regularly here and leave passengers to fend for themselves for a new travel plan and Itinerary",During
172," Love this airport nice tall windows, open concept we went through on a busy summer morning but was still able to zip right through on TSA pre check. Parking also was a breeze with several shuttles on site ready to pick up passengers. I believe the uncovered long term parking is $7 daily the parking garage is $23 yikes too much for me. My husband flies quite often out of this airport this was my first time flying out of Bergstrom airport will def be using again soon. Did I mention there's a Benefit makeup vending machine ladies? How cool is that? Just in case you forget your makeup.",During
173," Small and easy airport to get around in. They are clean and have friendly people working here. There is one small downfall if you arrive late in the evening  for the layover you may not find any restaurants opened. They close them early at least one of the layovers that I had back in October 2017. We stopped here to catch our next flight, but were only able to buy snacks because all their restaurants were closed. Other than that it's a great airport",During
174, Live music available on Fridays and weekends. CLEAR speeds you through the Security Checkpoints on busy Monday mornings when the TSA pre-check lines are too long. With 9 new gates on the way ABIA is one of the most modern airports in the USA.,During
175," The retal car location is great, just a quick walk across the street. Driving into the airport the lanes are identified for pick up/ drop off/ car return rental so I did not get lost at any time. On the down side we had to wait for over an hour for wheelchair service and they had to be called twice. When the person finally arrived she dedicated herself to tell us several times that we had too much luggage- we were 3 travelers each with a personal bag and carry in suitcases. She apparently thought she was the suitcase police- TSA checkpoint was not as smooth as other airports- they usually ask you to put everything in a bin but these TSA put shoes and my makeup bag directly on the belt with things flying everywhere- not one of the best airports in my book- I frequently fly between San Juan, DC, BWI.",During
176," Four stars mainly because I was impressed with the food court options around the Delta gates.  It felt like there were healthier options, rather than your typical fast food joints.  The place is still being renovated.  Also, CLEAR friendly airport, didn't really help much as it wasn't busy when we were there... but good to know.  Rental car terminal is walking distance from the airport, only a few off site rental companies.",During
177," Solid airport with food, clubs, shops and other amenities. Free WiFi. Reasonably close to Austin.",During
178," OMG!It's one of the worst airports I've seen.It seems the airport is not designed for this traffic!When we got there at 4:45 AM, the road to departure was almost blocked and there was no police or something to help.After we got inside, all we could see was huge lines for any services. It seems like every company, airline and department were short staff.Then we went to the counter! The agent could not check us in for both flights we had. Her scanner could not scan our passports and overall not very helpful.The TSA line was surprisingly more efficient than anything else.It wasn't a very clean airport and after security there are not many options for food or drink or ....Overall I didn't like the airports in Texas.If you want things go smooth, give half an hour to an hour extra on top of what you have estimated!",During
179," Awesome airport with plenty of affordable off site parking. I personally use The Parking Spot, East or West, depending on if I'm approaching from home or from the office. They also have plenty of onsite parking as well but it can be confusing on how to figure out which lot you want to park in. Of course the closer you park to the terminal the more expensive it is. This airport is well laid out with easy in and easy out for people and vehicles. Security is not that bad and the lines generally move fairly quickly. The airport offers a lot of various food vendors including the Salt Lick n Puke, I mean the Salt Lick BBQ which is totally disgusting Texas BBQ. This airport does have some awesome large guitars on display as Austin is the music capital of the world.",During
185," This is a nice, yet small airport. There is a ton of construction going on in the terminal, which is a little off putting but promises to be a great end result. I had a quick and pleasant time getting through security with Pre-check. There are many shops to browse with great souvenirs, and some great dining options to get a taste of Austin... such as Salt Lick BBQ and JuiceLand! My only complaint is the baggage claim was cramped and small, so it was very hard to squeeze through a crowd to obtain your luggage.",During
186," Guess I'm used to top of the line service at Sky Harbor in Phoenix because this airport is crap. Filthy isn't the word to describe it. Never taking a flight in or out of here again. We had to sit on the plane for an hour for an empty gate and then my departing flight was delayed 4 hours but they couldn't update anyone until last minute. Texas is known for going big....yeah, big pile of shit.",During
187," I've been to several airports across the country, both large and small. While ABIA is no LAX or O'Hare, I think it's something special. ABIA has definitely filled its terminal with the flavors of Austin instead of the chain businesses. I've lived in Austin for three years now and I still go early to take in the offerings of ABIA. Give yourself extra time here to take in the sights, sounds (yes, live music) and tastes ABIA has to offer.",During
188," This was my first time at this airport. It's big, but not LAX big. It was very clean and had a lot of great food options. I hope to be back in Austin soon!",During
189," Now that I have family and business in Austin, I've been here quite a few times in the last couple of years. It's an airport similar in size to Indianapolis, but holy cow, are they in need of an expansion! It's a nice airport, clean, and easy to navigate. With the sheer number of people moving to Austin and its popularity as a travel destination, they just need more space. I haven't had any issues with congestion, but I just know it's going to get to the point where it will be an issue. (And it may already be, judging by the experiences of some of the other reviewers.) There seem to be plenty of places to get a meal or snacks. The Salt Lick BBQ stand for breakfast tacos seems to be pretty popular. I haven't visited it yet, but breakfast tacos are definitely a thing in Texas.",During
190, Easy to maneuver around at. Uber and Lyft rides available. Nice airport to fly in and out of.,During
191," TSA people are super rude. There also aren't enough TSA lines so the lines get ridiculous. Lost my flight because of them not being better staffed. Overall, TSA and American Airline employees are rude and unhelpful. I will never go to Austin through their airport again.",During
192, The Bottom Line: A surprisingly well-run airport that gives a great first impression of Austin.,During
193," ABIA is attractive and offers some of the tastiest dining choices of any airport its size. TSA personnel are pleasant; lines are short; and there are a surprising and growing choice of non-stop destinations.  Bargain basement airlines fly from a second terminal. Automobile parking is served by city and private garages, including the remarkable Bark  Zoom, a 24/7/365 kennel with valet parking just across from the airport entrance. The airport used to be Bergstrom Air Force Base, a SAC B52 facility. It's changed just a bit since then...",During
194," Could be bigger but it fits my needs, the check In lines are so long but once to get in there, there are plenty of places to eat at. Everyone is pretty nice? Considering how long the lines are. Food is pretty good too",During

201," Horrible experience with car rental return: car rental return is in the parking garage, that is under construction. The last sign for Car Rental Return is so dusty it is hard to see in the dark (5:45 A.M. on May 19, 2018). I missed it twice and had to ask airport security. It took me 30 minutes to find it and I missed my flight! It is very unlikely I will ever fly into or out of this airport again.",During
202," Lots of construction right note and their pick up area was a mess at midnight.  They need traffic control and overhead pedestrian walkways or something. The inside is nice,  pretty much only local places are allowed inside so I hope you like local coffee,  because there is no starbucks. There is also some weird art in the entrance which needs signage because we debated for a bit if it was art or construction, but we decided it was art.",During
203," One of my favourite airports! Lots of vegetarian friendly options with quick service. Lots of charging ports around the airport, with a good chance of finding one that isn't taken! Staff are wonderful and all around a nice atmosphere",During
204," Horrible experience. There is trash everywhere and the airport has a bad smell. Also, the people at security are rude and looks like they hate life. I don't get this experience at the San Antonio airport. I had to fly through this one and I immediately regret this decision. Never flying out of this airport again and super disappointed. Austin please take care of your airport and have some pride this isn't 6th street.",During
205," I fly in and out of this airport a handful of times per year. I feel as the city of Austin continues to expand and we keep getting more tourist into the city,  the airport like many other austin features hasn't kept up to met the demand. Apparently someone let the cat out of the bag and informed the people that austin is in fact one of the best cities in the US. Oops #fakenewsI have had issues here now getting to my gate after security because of all the kiosks in the middle of the airport.  Also be aware of the sea of people who act like they have never flown before in their lives and stop right in front of you as you walk. The people who have lack airport etiquette can be found anywhere so not just an Austin thing. The food  drink choices are decent here if you want to eat before your flight. You can also fill up your water bottle for free with filtered water located near the restrooms. Score for people who prefer not to spend your life savings on a bottle of water.",During
206," Great check in time. My husband and I returned the rental car, checked In with airline, got passed airport security in less than 20 mins on a Monday morning. There is no starbucks here but tons of places to eat that smell delicious.",During
207," This is the worst airport experience I've had in over 10 years - security lines queued around airport - apparently due to UT graduation? And they don't use the data to notice that they are booked at certain times? Beyond ridiculous.  The delays were so bad I was regretting my decision to fly out of Austin.In addition when I did get to terminal there is no place to put coffee, so I sat on floor next to me in a very open area (everyone still standing in security terminal was empty) and cleaning lady came all the way over to sweep next to my cup of coffee. Excellent customer service Austin- who's in charge?",During
208," Easily the worst airport in the country. Avoid at all costs. It seems that Austin prides itself on being slow-paced, and airport is no exception.Also, there are no chain stores (think no Starbucks, no Subway, no Hudson). So if you want to get same old java, or same old greasy hash browns, be prepared to pay 3 times more.Wild capitalism disguised as ""locally owned"". Pathetic, really.",During
209," Great airport. Security is usually pretty quick, I've never had to wait more than 25-30 minutes, and often times you can find a checkpoint that is around a 10 minute wait (they have the approximate wait times posted). The food and drink is very true to local Austin businesses, and I'm glad they have some great local staples in there!",During
210," A very nice little airport that is very easy to navigate! When landed here it was very quick and easy to find baggage claim and to get our luggage! After getting our luggage it was very easy to get an uber (I love how they had the poles outside labeled to make it easy for your ride to find you). When it came time to fly out we got to the airport with less time to spare than I typically like, but were able to check our bags, get through security and find our gate all within 15min! This has to be the fastest ever! Would love if every airport could be this efficient!",During
216," The best airport in Texas period. Great food and beverage, a pledge to ""Keep Austin weird"" makes this one exceptional place to get stranded.",During
217," Bad airport, employees don't give you correct directions. The man working the information booth is super rude. I suggest getting there super early if you are going to south terminal it's about 15 minutes away not even in the same building. You have to take a cab/Uber which is $20 or you wait for the shuttle and it doesn't go frequently.",During
218," AUS is a small time airport with (currently) few amenities. As of this writing, I know there is a lot of construction going on so I will update my stars, when warranted. Until then, the only positive about AUS is that the location is close to where I need to travel in the Austin area. AUS also lags in terms of power and USB stations/outlets, coffee and grab/go options, and the overall appearance is lacking (or lagging) in terms of being nice and modern. And, seriously, the Saxon pub ... is that like from 1979? My hands get greasy thinking about that place.",During
219, This airport is clean and well kept. However parking is a nightmare. And navigating the airport is ridiculous. We missed our flight because of the layout and lack of parking,During
220," ABIA Long Term ParkingFabulous Service!  I drove in at 4:30 in the morning where uniformed guides with red-tipped wanded flashlights guided directly to a spot to park.  What I did not know is that they keep track of where they park you and note what time you entered the lot.  Getting on the shuttle was easy and painless, the driver handled my suitcase, and we were at the terminal in less than five minutes.  A day into my trip I realized that I lost my Parking Locator Card (PLC).  So, I sent an email through the ABIA website explaining that I lost my PLC and did not know which lot I was in.  A very gracious man named Tom Rafferty responded and told me exactly where my car was parked.  He had sent a driver out into the lot based on the time we arrived, and found my car.  When we returned to ABIA, the waiting line for the shuttle was long, but within a few minutes three shuttle showed up and we were off to the parking lot, and ""Viola!"", my car was exactly where he said it would be.  At seven dollars per day, with service like this, I will use them again.",During
221, Its a great small airport. This past visit was kind of different things are slowly changing all the ceiling was under construction and it looks great. It takes almost no time to get through security. They also have a few little distinct features that truly represent Austin. I did notice my boarding area microphone system didn't work properly which left a lot of customers confused. But I mean one small issue that's easily repairable. Flying near or around the area land or fly out of Austin airport it's a nice little airport with a big hint of Austin culture. Give it a shot.,During
222, Nice little airport that was very easy to navigate as their aren't many gates. It's under construction so not a ton of food options but I'm sure it'll be great once everything is complete.,During
223," Easy in easy out lol! Very fast check in process - good food too, I recommend stopping at I Vini for a sandwich",During
224, The airport is under construction and space is limited.  The walkway between gates is tight during peak times.  The restaurant options are limited due to construction.,During
225, I've watched the airport from since the time they closed the Air Force base and converted it to commercial use. Back then it was a half baked effort to use it as a commercial airport. Fast forward almost 20+ years and it is a phenomenal airport. Though a lot of the vendors are not able to cook fast enough (Salt Lick) and the line is so long it congests the passing traffic. So they need to work on setting up queues so people lingering are not blocking the path to the gates.,During
231," I personally disliked this airport when I came here for a conference, and I've been to plenty since I've flown cross-country quite a bit, usually with 1-2 transfers. I can see why it gets rated well -- there's certainly a lot of fun stuff in the airport and it targets the right audience with the music scene in Austin and the Southwest music festival. There's a bandstand, barbeque, and a lot of entertainment. What it actually lacked was a place for nursing moms to pump, aside from the little mamava-style pod that was near the TSA exit. It was full for a loooooong time and the airport is kinda one big circle so I figured I'd go look for a place to pump closer to my gate (pretty far). I finally get over there across the obstacle course of bandstand, cramped restaurants, gimmicky stores, construction areas, and etc, only to find out that pod was the only place to nurse / pump in this airport. I had arrived plenty before my flight but fighting the crowd and awful clutter to get to my gate was not worth heading back to the one pod which may or may not have been full. This wasn't even about nursing, as I don't have a problem with nursing in public. I needed a place that had an outlet and for me to set things up in a clean environment, not do this in the same room that we all piss and shit in. Fortunately I had pumped right before I left for the airport, but I knew I was facing a 5 hour flight so I was definitely looking desperately at the clock in the last hour before touchdown, and anyone who's a pumping mom knows doing this in economy class with 2 ppl less than 5 inches away is unpleasant and embarrassing, or unsanitary when in the bathroom. Other than that, there's also a lot of birds in here (glad nobody had to poop) and Lyft pickup was a little confusing since it's not where all the cabs are. TSA was fast but they corralled us all to a line that was much faster (which is how I ended up so far from my gate but overall speaking it's not a large airport).",During
232," AUS airport makes sense. It's the gateway in and out of Austin and it does its job. I worry that this airport's operations will become congested like Denver airport in the future as the city becomes more popular. It's your everyday airport that takes it easy like the city of Austin. One day, it will need to step it up however as the city builds out its high-rise apartment and office buildings. To the airport staff that's reading this review, don't become like Denver airport. You're being forewarned.--------------------------------------------------QUICK TIPS:--------------------------------------------------# For now, fly in and fly out with ease and be welcomed into the Austin city limits with warmth. We'll see in the future. I'm not giving it a 5 because this will serve as a cautionary review for the airport entity.",During
233, Great clean airport with plenty of food choices. Easy to get around with car rentals within walking distance.,During
234," In so many ways What an airport should be...great food, easy to find places to charge, well labeled gates but the lines can be very long. I was going through on final 4 weekend so i suspect that may have something to do with it lol.",During
235," Sooo TSA was super slow today.  There was only two lanes opened. It looked like every 5 persons was ""personally scanned"" during which, they stop the whole process and not let anyone through until the person selected to be scanned was led away....then they began the process again.  I feel the regular lines we're faster than TSA today.  They were testing a new thing out with not enough staff on Easter morning.  Still a clean airport but lots of construction going on so it gets a bit confusing.",During
236, Nice airport! Small but efficient!Baggage claim is at the bottom.  We received our luggage a even before we arrived at the baggage claim!  We didn't have to wait at all!  That's a first! Car rental line was decent but not terrible.  We did arrive early!,During

239," It's Spring Break  SXSW, you would think heavy staffing would be appropriate.Skycap is usually my go-to when it's cray cray busy inside, but as you can see they even had a bit of the cray cray.However, the ONE attendant at Skycap was pleasant, singing his way through the chaos. Part of me wanted me to tell him to ""shut up and keep it moving!"" But the humane side of me stayed rational. I know this wasn't the airport's doing but you'd think American Airlines would've better staffed with Spring Break  SXSW happening.Another thing to note, I think it was mating call season bc the birds outside were loud and hell!! And I'm not bird expert but I'm sure it was mating calls bc my animal instinct felt a bit uncomfortable as a voyeur. There was some hanky panky def being intimated.",During
240, Best airport to fly out and in on a plane. Good customer service and short lines. Good food. And not as busy as other airports.,During
241," Keep Austin Weird - cute slogan for a great city, but if the path to get there involves the airport opt for carry on ..... been here at least twenty times over last 12 months and each time is a reminder of how awful an airport can be when it's apparently staffed with one baggage handler, one transporter, carrying one bag at a time - takes at least one hour to get bags in Austin so take your time moseying on down from the gate. Get your act together Austin - easy fix - this is definitely a poor introduction and entry point.",During

249," Love this airport. Just the right size. Easy to drive to and easy to navigate once you reach the airport. Not a great selection of places to eat but it will do. It's a breeze getting through security, usually takes me 5 minutes with a TSA pre check. Can't say enough good about this airport.",During
250, Nice restaurants and among the fastest bag claim I've seen in a long while. Uber pickup is a mess and the walk to the rental car facility is a joke. Little signage and directions and when you get to the desk one person with 5-6 peeps in line. Advantage i think not.,During
251, This airport is pretty insane. Probably one of the best I've been to.There's a freakin' VICTORIA'S SECRET in this place. And a Brooks Brothers. And like a ton of other stores. You could seriously go shopping here if you wanted to! There's cool pieces of artwork everywhere that I saw lots of parents taking pictures of their kids next to. Kind of a cool thing to distract you if you're killing time.Lots of places to sit and work while you're waiting which I appreciated.Probably one of my favorite airports that I've been to!,During
252," I've flown into Austin regional airport before. Just hadn't gotten around to filing a review for it, I guess. My most recent experience here was in February 2018. The last was February 2010. Long time!Austin Texas serves as Texas's state capital, but it's airport is small and regional compared to other mega airports in the state. Of note, airports in Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, which has two airports. My most recent experience flying into Austin was through Delta Airlines via Los Angeles, whereas the last was through United Airlines via Houston - Bush. Still, the destination was clear and it was Austin. For me though, flying to Austin was the solution versus into DFW or IAH, even though it can be pretty pricey to arrive here versus other destinations in Texas. The terminal itself seemed smaller than it should be, but it held up to 15 gates. The major airlines service Austin Texas, including Southwest Airlines too, so that's awesome. In my experience, getting out of AUS took about 10-15 minutes after deplaning to the baggage claim and ground transportation. I arrived  AUS 1 1/2 hours before departure and that was pretty substantial too. The overall experience here at Austin regional airport was good and expeditious. I'm glad that Bnamban Austin has a busy regional airport hub here in Texas, so that anyone who needs to travel to Austin has a place to jet set to. The car rental  facility is really next door to the terminal, so that's pretty cool, even though I have yet to rent from the airport location yet. I opted to do my rental car elsewhere, since prices at the airport were more pricey than outside at the time of booking. I got lucky with friends helping me to pick me up and drop me off at the airport before and after getting and returning the rental car off airport, but do have a plan in place for that - usually use Uber or lyft if available in the area. The Austin regional airport is located on the eastern side of the city and is accessible from Texas highways 183 and 71, but I-35 isn't too far away either. I'm glad that Austin airport does not have an entrance fee, which I have learned that Dallas/Fort Worth airport does - even for simply dropping off someone! Crazy! The Austin regional airport does do amazing work, especially helping travelers get in and out of Austin through its terminals and out into the world. They have some bathrooms and the food options are pretty good, although I would suggest eating outside before checking into the airport for your flight. It can be way cheaper if you decide to do so. The airport terminal is always clean and optimized for your traveling needs. I am surprised that there is a good amount of people traveling through Austin at any given time. It's just like any regional airport in the country, but best bet would be to grab lunch or dinner before heading out of Austin. The TSA process is rather quick here, if you have the TSA pre-check designation. I probably got through everything A-okay within 5 minutes. For the traveling public, you may need up to 10-15 minutes through security. For best solutions, you just get in and get out without much headaches. The airport terminal itself is clean and air conditioned. I think they have wifi, but not sure on that. 4.0 stars for the overall experience. 4.0 stars for the comfort and ease of getting through TSA security. Easily marked signs to get where you need to go. Support local!B",During
253," Definitely one of the nicer airports around.  Always spotless, decent food choices. Salt Lick is even here. Earl Campbell's place is not bad either.  Usually excellent TSA wait times. Live Music plays often. Bags are pretty quick as well. Good souvenir stores. Traffic can be a bitch getting to airport so plan ahead. Love the fact they now have car rental facility at the airport. I wish they would put a moving walkway between the buildings as the walk with luggage can be a pain to the car facility. The airport needs more charging areas as well as a bit more seating. I think one more nice restaurant like Pappasitos would be nice too. Overall I Love landing here because I know I am in The Great State of Texas! YeeHaw!",During
254," This is my favorite airport, and it is only slightly because it is the gateway to my favorite place in the world. (I cry when I arrive and when I leave for the opposite reasons.) Really, this is just a cool, fun airport. It has a ton of food choices that embrace the local flavor: Salt Lick, Amy's Ice Creams, Thundercloud Subs (the single vegan option is there, but at least there is one!). Often there is often live music, and nothing beats arriving and hearing music floating through the concourse. The design is appealing with high, airy ceilings and lots of art that represents all the great things that make Austin special. They have attempted to address the parking nightmare with more garages, and the rental car facility is attached, meaning you don't have to deal with taking a shuttle off-site. (I am always a big fan of that.)Best of all? The Texas flags on every gate. I know I am home then!",During
255," It may be smaller than a lot of airports, but it is in my opinion the coolest. It's also always spotless! This the cleanest airport I've ever flown in to, or out of. Great restaurants where you can try authentically Texan food. Fantastic shops where you can get the neatest souvenirs. If you're flying in to central Texas, fly in to Bergstrom.",During
256, I hate flying but I love this airport. Everyone is always really helpful and friendly. Gotta love Austin. And they took EXTRA good care or my mom who is in a wheelchair.,During
262," First time here and my my, the TSA/ security patrols are polite. This airport is on the smaller side, we returned our car that is due at 4pm (we got there 345p) and now I'm sitting at my gate at 4:15p. Yep, thru the scanner and everything. Well, my hubs and are fast paced in general. When you're free LA... time is everything. So we were VERY efficient, know airport rules/regulations... which helps the process. I would def recommend this airport!",During
263, Another pretty airport in Texas!,During
264," Austin's airport definitely in some ways was better than Newark Airport  JFK. Austin's airport was pretty interesting and entertaining (tons of artwork  had live music). It was super clean  offered a lot of healthier food options besides BBQ and southern foods. There was also a lot of interesting souvenir shops to visit. I had an hour and 30 minutes to kill, and time flew by. There was so much to see and do in the airport. The people who worked there was also very nice (comparing it to NY). I had a wonderful time in Austin - the food was delicious and the people are one of the nicest and most friendliest in the US area. Highly recommend anyone to visit Austin!",During
265," We flew through this airport for a 3 day weekend trip and this airport was very convenient. The best thing about it is that the rental car lot is walking distance from the terminals!!! We rented a car downtown and returned it to the airport. Most airports require another shuttle ride to get to the terminals, but this airport was literally just a sky bridge across. With a baby and stroller, this makes it so much easier. Otherwise, the line for security on a Sunday afternoon took about 20 minutes. They went through all our baby food very slowly which is why I knocked off a star. So go early if you have kids! The staff was very kind and friendly which made the experience much nicer. The airport also has amazing food options! Amy's ice cream, salt lick (although it's not as good as the original I imagine), salt lick taco bar, the list goes on. Overall, 5 stars for convenient rental car lot location4 stars for security efficiency5 stars for airport food!",During
266," Not as crowded as Houston or DFW, but that's all it has going for it. Restaurants were all weirdly unfriendly or  mostly closed at 7:30 pm (???) Also, the bathrooms were few and far between and not quite as clean as DFW's or Houston's...or Calcutta's.",During
267," So I did not like this airport, for multiple reasons. Not sure if I'm biased, coming from mostly bigger cities or what.So first off, they have a 'secondary' terminal that is a 15 min shuttle ride from the main terminal even though it's right across from the main terminal... Annoying, but I guess that's what happens when smaller airports need to expand.On the return leg, I was in the main terminal. The gates/seating is pretty limited but security moved quick enough, so kudos for that.Isn't one of my top airports but it's a smaller one, and seems like it's having growning pains right now",During
268," The perfect size airport for a city! This airport is easy to navigate with smooth check-in and security system. On a Tuesday morning, it was not difficult to beat the lines. There is plenty of space and security lines. There are also a good amount of dining options. The bathrooms are clean, which is a plus!There is construction at the moment so returning my rental car was a bit challenging due to the way finding signs. There did not seem to be many gas stations around so be sure to fill up your gas tank 5-10 min out before you arrive. I found a gas station that was only 2 minutes away (this was by luck). I do not mind stopping here again in the future.",During
269," Relatively small (although quickly expanding) clean and well organized airport. There are shuttles and plenty of access to cabs. Food options are also great and a solid representation of some of Austin's popular restaurants. Had to take off one star because security at this airport seem to have it out for me- pulling my carry on for extra searching, etc",During
270," I always use this airport since it's the closest to my house. It's a pretty big airport, inside and out. Lots of seating and room to walk around if you're waiting for your flight. Can be kind of confusing since there are so many ramps and lanes to take to get to the drop off and pickup places though. Also confusing inside, definitely got lost a handful of times (but I'm also not the best at navigating my way around places to begin with, oops). The inside looks cool too. There are some interesting sculptures, statues, and paintings to look at if you ever have a delayed flight or something. Baggage claim and security checks can take a long time, but then again that happens in just about every airport. I do like how close the baggage carousel was to the exit though. I didn't have to lug my suitcase too far to get to my car. There's also lots of places to sit outside which is nice if you end up needing to wait a while for your ride, like I did!",During
271, Efficient airport. Plenty of restaurants and a handful of bars. Only issue is the TSA line was extra slow,During
277," It's an interesting spread of an airport with the most lax security I've ever seen, but I guess that's Texas for you. In, out and on a plane within fifteen is about average and the walking distance is the only real complaint. Great for Pokemon Go.",During
278, Great food with local cuisine. Self serve coffee station for $2. Easy access for departures and arrivals. Great layout with most gates open to all restaurants and gift stores.,During
279," This is the best (almost) of all worlds, in my view. Free WiFi. Vino Volo, the wine bar that is a great choice for a short or long layover. May I say that Texas wines are great! Fall Creek unoaked Chardonnay is a-maz -ing!! The airport is small enough to get through quickly. Last, but not least, the have Clear!! This allows me (or anyone with Clear) to go thru a VIP line. That plus TSA Precheck - heaven!!!",During
280, Nice little airport. The terminal is nice and clean. There are no moving walkways but you don't have to walk very far to get to gates.  There are a a handful fast food restaurants and some bars.  Plenty of displays that show you show departure and arrival schedules.  The security check points were backed up on the morning I flew out thank goodness for Global Entry as I got through in less than ten minutes.,During
281," Quite possibly the worst airport ever for trying to find a quick bite to eat. Their insistence on local shops and restaurants is commendable but these establishments are completely incapable of quickly serving large numbers of people. Many restaurants and eateries at AUS have a single person taking orders at a single register. Almost every line is long and slow at lunchtime. And if by some chance you were there when their lines are short, the food still takes a long time to come out.The local stores should be mixed in with a couple of fast efficient chains. Nothing has ever made me want the crisp corporate efficiency of a McDonalds more than the Austin airport.",During
282," This is a modern, spacious airport with generally good signage. When we landed here, it was easy to find our way over to the rental building to pick up our rental car. The terminal connects to the rental building via a pedestrian bridge, so there was no having to play human Frogger with vehicular traffic.The airport is full of interesting statues and other artwork. Worth walking around to take a look, especially since the selection of lounges is limited (e.g. no Priority Pass lounge).The seats at the gate were not equipped with power outlets, but my gate had a narrow table where a couple people could sit and plug in. The WiFi was free and reliable, but I had to watch an ad in order to be able to use it. Whatever lets me get my online work and cat video watching done.",During
283," AUS has def gone down hill the last few years. For a city that wants to be known as a technology driven and modern place the airport is a horrid example of the opposite that people experience as soon as they touch down. The terminal NEEDS to be enlarged something fierce. Instead of building new parking structures they need to be adding on to the terminal. Seating is ridiculous, no charging stations to speak of unless you count wall outlets. The food selections are fairly pathetic anymore. The WIFI rarely if ever works. And quite frankly the number of people flying in and out of AUS has dramatically increased over the last few years. This place has a lot of work that needs to be done to it",During
284," This is one of my favorite airports. It's not very big but for an airport this size it has pretty much everything you could need while waiting for your flight. It is also one of the few remaining airports that has it's rental car area still on site. The food offerings are plentiful and going thru TSA is fairly quick. There used to be live music here sometimes although the last couple of times I was there, there was a stage but no music.",During
285," Of all of the airports that I have been to this is probably one of my favorite ones. It has some neat art, good food, plenty of clean restrooms, water bottle refill stations, curb side luggage check, and TSA is fairly easy to get past. There are plenty other airports that are way worse.",During
286," Arrival- When we arrived, the baggage carousels still had Christmas decorations, which was nice. The rental car companies are across the street in another building. There's live music played here, but I didn't hear or see any. Departure- There are three security check points, which I think speeds up the process. But when we were at one, they has us go to another one. It was a hassle. Because we were there early, I was able to enjoy free WiFi and Amy's Ice Cream. There were also other local eateries at the airport.",During
287," ABIA is a small city airport. We are just in the past couple of years getting direct flights out of country. There's a non-stop to Mexico, England, and Germany last I looked a couple of months ago. There are only about 22 Gates and the airport is set up in a straight line with Gate 1 on one side and Gate 22 on the other. There are also only three security points; one in the middle and two flanking the sides. They do offer TSA Pre and CLEAR here. Though, I've found that sometimes the security checkpoint to the right heading toward the higher Gate numbers doesn't always have TSA Pre going and you'll end up having to take your laptop out anyway. I usually stick with the middle or left (headed toward lower numbered Gates) to make sure I get TSA Pre. ABIA has a number of shops, restaurants, bars, and live music going on through security. The restaurants are mostly all different throughout the airport and should be able to accommodate most preferences. And the shops are pretty good for Austin or Texas souvenirs and cool local items. They also have a number of water bottle filling stations generally located near the bathrooms. We don't have terminals, so if you're calling a ride share you tell them which Pillar you're at. The rental car agencies are across from departures. It's on the top floor (only two levels). You just walk outside from departures across the street and there Your are. Or, you can walk across the road from arrivals and use the elevators to get there. ABIA is about 15 minutes drive out of town. Of course, it take a little longer if you're in rush hour.",During
293," This airport is beautiful, clean, awesome, and fantastic to come through as a crew member.  Great food selection.  Lots of local choices.  Live music playing.  Friendly gate agents.  Warm, homey feel.  I'll come fly here any day.",During
294," Is it the greatest airport in the world? No.  But I will tell you, it sure is easy to navigate around.  One terminal certainly means simplicity.  On top of the easiness factor you will find yourself passing some good food options like Salt Lick BBQ, Maudie's Tex Mex, and Amy's Ice cream in the food court. I like the setup of the AA Lounge upstairs as well.  It is the first one I have seen serve La Colombe coffee.  Hopefully that becomes a thing everywhere.  While simplicity is certainly good there are some things that are forfeited for that simplicity.  Simple means less options. The food places I named are decent but their operating hours aren't great.  Additionally, from a flight perspective there are only direct flights to certain major hubs and even those flights are few and far between.  Since this is not a hub airport you will often find yourself needing to connect through Houston / Dallas depending on where you want to go.  If Austin ever becomes a hub, I am moving there the first chance I get. I love Austin dearly but I travel too darn much (every week) to be okay with an airport with such limited options. It is literally the reason that I do not live in Austin today.",During
295," I found this airport to be very easy.  Smaller airport, easy in and easy out.  Hard to get lost.  Offer a good variety of options and many airlines go in and out of Austin",During
296," Austin has a really nice airport.  It's usually not too crowded and the TSA lines are short and go quickly. The rental cars are onsite, so there's no bus to catch. The layout is simple with one long terminal, making it easy to go from gate to gate. The atmosphere is better than most airports, with good food choices, including local places, like Salt Lick BBQ.  But it beats every other airport with its live music performers, providing a nice touch for travelers.  I use the airport a lot and really like it.",During
297," Where are the signs???It's far too easy to wind up in long-term parking instead of rental car return.  (I made that mistake)After a LONG walk from the rental return to the terminal (on a VERY slippery-when-wet outdoor walkway), there are no signs to indicate which airlines ticket to the left or the right.  I guessed left for my airline, and of course I was wrong.Airports should expect a significant number of people that have never been there before.  Austin is not prepared for out of towners.There is very little seating near each gate.  I assume that one reason is that the narrow terminal surrendered a lot of space to concessions.  This place needs a do-over.",During
298," Returned rental car to the wrong place because of poorly visible sign. Presented myself to the agent at Avis at airport. He initially admitted this happens ""all the time"" because of poor visibility of signage yet nothing is being done about it. I had to take shuttle back and retrieve the car or, per the ""manager"" ""Thuy"", who was very rude and didn't even greet me, said I will be charged a penalty on the cc they have on file. Very rude Thuy. She needs to know how to absorb customer's worry especially when they are about to miss a flight. 45 minutes later I got the car...A smile can go a long way. She needs another job that doesn't involve people for sure. Never again....Horrible customer service",During
299," I have been to lots of airports and AUS was very enjoyable! There are lots of food options (including a Salt Lick which is amazing BBQ food) and was easy to navigate. This may sound silly, but don't worry if you don't have time to eat before you go-you will have plenty of options. I loved all the art and sculptures around the airport. Makes it not dull and gives you someone to look at during layovers or waiting to board. We were flying in and renting a car...never having been there before I was a little concerned about finding the car rental area. Luckily there were multiple information stands and everyone was very helpful. The rental car counter was connected to the airport-making it super easy to get in and out of the airport. Can't wait to be back!",During
300, Great airport with plenty of local food options (breakfast tacos...yes please)  and live music in almost every terminal. It is always clean and there are a lot of charging stations for your portable devices.  Security is very quick and efficient and overall AUS is a well oiled airport.,During
301," Our airport is the best. Yes, it's tiny, but it has everything you need. The businesses there are local, and they also showcase local live musicians. In fact, returning to Austin you get hit in the face with nostalgia as you pass by beloved restaurants you haven't seen in days that have felt like months. I've flown several times, and I rarely have to wait. I'm not saying wait until the last minute, truly, but I have many times and I've always made it through security with time to spare.",During
302," Overall I am usually pretty happy with ABIA, my Home airport for 20-25 trips per year. However, my experience with the south terminal this last week was not good. First, I parked my car and started walking to the terminal which was nearby when the shuttle driver chased me down and talked me into getting in the shuttle.She then proceeded to circle the lot for 15 minutes chasing down other drivers who didn't want rides either, or who weren't ready to board the shuttle. In the terminal there must have been 30 employees walking around doing nothing, but just one person handling luggage and managing ground control. Also, if you need to catch a shuttle from the main terminal to the south terminal, you have to call dispatch for a ride, then they will drive you past the parking lot where your car is parked (can't stop and let you out) but instead make you ride to the terminal only to take another shuttle to your car.",During
308," This airport is pretty easy. Coming in and leaving everything was fast and simple. The security line was slow, but thankfully it was not long. There are a good amount of food options for an airport of this size. I did like that it was easy to get picked up by Uber. I did not have to seek out the area. I walked out the door and I was there.",During
309," Getting in and out of Austin-Bergstrom is always quick and uneventful.  As I'm generally arriving from or headed back to Atlanta on my way to Greenville the flight times are always plentiful and its super easy to get to either the rental car area or Uber area.  I don't recall eating at any of the restaurants as I usually do a pre-six AM flight.  I can say, it was very disappointing that the gift shop near my terminal didn't have Coke Zero Sugar as they normally do.  This is an easy airport to deal with, that's really all you can ask for if you travel a lot.",During
310," Well it's an airport. I have to say that I was a little surprised that it's as small as it is. There's basically just one terminal and you can walk the whole thing end to end in not a whole lot of time. That said, I think that this is one of those small airports that's on its way to being a large airport. It clearly is just about at capacity -- the security can be slow (even though I have never personally had a major issues, I've heard the stories). Walking around it seems like there are always too many people for the available walking area. I do enjoy the dining options, which are just generally different than most airports (I do have a soft spot for Schlotzsky's Deli), and there are of course your average Texas-themed joints. The last time I was here, I was with about 10 friends from a conference we were all attending and we literally could not find one place that could accommodate our larger group. We finally wound up staking out a spot at one of the restaurants and just waiting until the tables near us cleared out and then pushing three tables together. The gift shops are fun to look at if you have time to kill, places to sit are plentiful. I enjoy that they have the big bottle filling water stations and not just water fountains. It's an airport!",During
311," Worst service ever. We always look forward to going thru Austin airport and having a couple glasses of wine and the cheese board. Well thanks to the waiter, he blew all that to hell. Rude spoke down to my wife. If there weren't a lot of witnesses I'd of bitch slapped him. I can say if that asshat is working there, we will be passing by. They should have a shit icon to really score accurately. Hey vino bolo management better look at your videos and you can see who it is. Happened at your Austin airport about 745 pm 26 Oct 2017.",During
312," Good , clean, not too crowded - what more can you ask for?There is a salt lick inside too if you don't have time to go to the original - good bbq- get the ribs only here though. When I landed- everything was clear and smooth. I love that the rental car area is walkable- NO SHUTTLE- I'm looking at you LAX. TSA pre check has basically no line here. Everyone is REALLY nice here, holla Texas!",During
313, Nice airport.  Not much else to say.  The car rental place is outside in another building.,During
314," This airport smells like urine. Like a giant cat box full of just urine. Has been this way for at least a year in the East wing mostly. This is essentially a biohazard. Edit: i live here and love it, just giving an honest review, be prepared.",During
315, This is a great airport I fly more then I want to and travel to a lot of airports. But this is definitely my favorite one. Keep up the good job,During
316, Beware of pigz at the pick up area. They are bullies willing to give you tickets for picking up your passengers or even arrest you. Better park in short term parking building and avoid these power high school drop outz.,During
317, Love this airport very small and easy to get around very clean and organized going past security is very fast.,During
323," Small but expanding airport. Convenient and easy to get to and from. You do go through a sketchy part of town  though just due to location. The airline ticketing co Byers are not expansive and are close together making checkin most convenient in that you don't have to spend 5-10 minutes walking to get to your airline once inside.Security lines/TSA were well staffed and move quickly. I do have PreCheck but observed the normal lines also moved rather quick. There is a monitor that said 14-16 minutes to get through security but it took less than 5 minutes.Once through security, gates are also close by with a number of shops and restaurants near them if you have time to kill before boarding your flight. I often don't do reviews of airport as most would be negative reviews but thought I'd give Austin-Bergstrom a shoutout since I had a pretty smooth experience coming through here on several occasions.The only reasons for the lacking 5th star is the rental car areas could be designed better so less walking for flyers to and from lots...picking up and returning cars. After a 4 hr flight, the lasting I want to do is walk in the dark for 10 minutes to pickup the rental car. The 5th star is also reserved for the renovations to be seen in the near future.Hopefully they will out in a Delta Sky Lounge or another lounge system too. That's all I have for now.",During
324," What a great small airport! Everything is very clean, neat, organized and the check-in and security were easy and very fast. Lots of great stores and kiosks, plenty of seating and signs were very easy to follow. Even though I didn't get something to eat, there was a great variety of food/drink establishments to choose from.",During
325," YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017 - PART 3: 77/100This review has been long due. What's there not to like about this airport?! Parking is right across the street. All car rentals are also across the street. They've figured out a way to make going through TSA efficient. There are always interesting eateries or bars near all the gates for a quick snack or drinks (time permitting, of course.) CLEAN. I've never hit a snag here, and I've gone through this airport more than enough times. Here's hoping it stays that way!",During
326," This airport represents the city of austin well. They're quite efficient, so the lines for security Check went quick. I also enjoyed a pretty good breakfast burrito for my flight back to DC.I hope to come back to Austin again, and look forward to exploring this airport more closely. I don't know why, but I'm a fan of walking around airports. Is it just me?",During
327, Love my home-based airport and SW Airlines.  Security is always relatively quick to navigate (check the point in the middle for quickest entrance).  Live music often and BBQ in the terminal - what more could you want?!?,During
328," I like this airport! There is a nice selection of food vendors to choose from. The airport is modern and easy to navigate. I do wish there were more places to plug in by AA's gates. Most people were using wall outlets and the limited triple seating at the end of rows with hinckey power outlets in the floor.  My iphone kept cutting out because my neighbor was pulling on his cord. Overall, recommend.",During
329," Smoothest airport I have ever been in. Security line moved quickly. Didn't even have to take off shoes or use bins. The service agent directed all to put our belongings in our bag to be scanned. Done, and done.",During
330," I've traveled all over the world and have a love/hate relationship with airports. This one definitely leans more towards love.It's a relatively small airport but it boasts so much without seeming junked up.Lots of art all about which is what you'd expect from Austin. And of course the airport bars have live music as well. This is cool because when you're leaving such can awesome city you get one more taste of the goodness before boarding a plane.I also love that the restaurants, bars were mostly local chains only.Flying in and out of his airport was painless.",During
331," Need more coffee shops--otherwise this airport is dialed.  Easy in/out, friendly staff, interesting shops BUT you can't have two coffee shops for this many terminals.missed opportunity and made the experience blah..",During
332," Austin has some of the nicest people!!!! However the TSA lady acted a fool this morning! I witnessed her yell at two men.... ""SIR! WHY do you have your phone"" ""SIR, SIR, SIR.... go on through the scanner"" geeszzzee lady it's 6AM!!!! Why are you so angry it's only 10 people in the check out line....Other than that, the airport is clean, and small just the way I like it!",During
338," Really great Airport!  Modern, clean and easy to navigate.  I always love it when my luggage beats me downstairs, so A+ for efficiency!  They also have a lot of cool shops and authentic Texas BBQ inside.",During
339," We flew in and out on Southwest and we both thought that overall, AUS was a fairly small airport for what I would consider a fairly large city with a growing reputation.  The airport didn't have many places to eat but several food court type places that seem to duplicate themselves after you walk halfway through the airport.  The airport baggage pickup is sort of right below the departure/arrival gates, which is convenient (no tram) and the baggage layout reminded me of Vegas.  We didn't notice an Priority Pass lounges here but the airport was operating effectively in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey so I have to give them props for keeping all the planes in and out of Austin.",During
340," This airport is better than San Diego's!!! So many food places, shopping, and the architect is beautiful. The people that work here are soooooo awesome and kind!! Going through TSA was a breeze and it was packed. Took about 5-10 mins.",During
341, Nice airport! Feels new and very Austin-y!Lots of nice restaurants and food options. Very clean. Convenient location in Austin. It is quite a walk to get to rental car area if you have children and luggage that you are hauling. The rental car area is located across from airport in parking garage area so it is also a plus you don't have to take a shuttle off site.Baggage claim seemed to take quite a while but there seemed to be quite a few flights arriving at the same time.Security was very efficient. Appreciate that they have a time estimate at each of the checkpoints and encourage you to go to another one if no line. Would happily fly in and out of here any time!,During
342," Rude employees and they let a person who could barely function, due to being drunk, on the flight; even the restaurant workers were rude, unprofessional and seriously ratchet. We asked one place ""what was the soup of the day?"" Because the menu stated ""dress soups daily""...she snarled up her lip and replied ""it's French onion errryday, like yeah...."" IJS not impressed and some of the employees need more training in ethics, customer service and professionalism.",During
343," It's funny...I know this airport super well but have held off on reviewing it as I have been waiting for a lot of renovations taking place before letting people know what to think as they walk into Texas' weirdest city via the airways.  Unfortunately, ABIA is far behind the pace of growth of the city and it's Businesses reflect the state of the city 10 years ago when I started flying here frequently.  The biggest problem is that they have no good management policy for the bars.  Planes are regularly late coming in from the east coast and the restaurants and bars seem oblivious to this as passengers arrive at the airport only to find out there are no restaurants or bars open to serve them dinner or a drink while they wait.For instance, my D.C. Originating plane is 2 hours late, as it often is and I am at ABIA at 8:45 on a Wednesday and have walked the entire .4 miles of this airport (as I often do) and have found not one restaurant or bar open to buy a drink.  It is not difficult to have management take a look at the flight schedule and realize that people are going to need to eat and drink later than maybe normal and assign a place to serve them.Oh well, maybe some time this half-hearted airport mentality will catch up with the growth and pace of the city it serves.",During
344, Nice airport but the TSA don't have a care in the world. Time doesn't exist for them and they don't care where your stuff is.,During
345, This is a typical airport that didn't have anything remarkable that stood out. It did have clean restrooms which was a plus.,During
346, One of the better airports imo compared to Ft. Lauderdale at least. Surprisingly it's just one big terminal servicing a bunch of airlines and the drop off/pickup areas have been smooth the two times I've had to be at the airport. No trouble at TSA.A good amount of food options. Local places like Salt Lick and Amy's. Outlets aren't hard to find to charge your electronics and bathrooms are clean and spacious.,During
347," I really didn't like this airport. When I first walked in it smelled like old pee but I assumed that it was just the construction project towards the entrance. But as I got deep inside the airport it still smelled that way and I think it is some sort of intentional scent gone very wrong. On top of that the signage both inside and outside of the airport was pretty tough to navigate and adding to my irritation was when TSA moved us all to a ""shorter"" line that we had to walk a mile to get to and then ended up being the same size line by the time we were all added to it.Lunch prices were shockingly high even for an airport.",During
353," I flew southwest awhile back and loved the convenient kiosks. You really need to ditch that taco restaurant. ""Best tacos in Austin"".Hilarious. Lmfao!!!!!I'm not a tourist, I live in Austin.",During
354, Nice airport. Reminds me of Love Field in Dallas. The bathrooms are super clean which is important to me. My only issue is there aren't that many electric outlets in the terminals and the ones that are there are clumped together making it difficult to share.,During
355, This is the second time in a row I have come to the airport and found that the parking lots are completely full. Don't try to park at Austin airport. Park offsite and take a shuttle or grab a friend to drop you off. Very poor planning on their part.,During
356," TSA-pre travelers, beware. Scanners are outdated and malfunctioning - unable to scan drivers licenses from certain states. Have flown through Houston IAH, Chicago ORD / MDW, LAX, SFO in the last month with zero TSA issues - AUS technology appears stuck in the 90s. On the upside, Salt Lick at the airport makes AUS slightly more bearable.",During
357," Poorly labeled airport - inside and outside, free wifi, limited budget dining options. Cons: Maybe I've been spoiled by ""larger"" airports like MCO, IAH and HOU but the signage inside and outside of the airport could use some revision. Maybe it's the construction changes or other random events that led my google maps to the tarmac terminal - not the main concourse terminal - which both appears to have the SAME address. Airline check-in counters are also signage free - so get ready to walk to where your airline is by randomly guessing where their counter is located. If you are renting a car and traveling with others, you might want to grab your car first - then pickup the rest of your party and luggage at the arrival area. Otherwise, be prepared to walk about .5 miles with a quarter of it outside. While I realize that Austin is the ""southern"" Williamsburg Brooklyn, it would be a little nice to find some food reasonably priced, even by airport standards. There are plenty of places to eat if you are willing to pay $20+ per person. I assume the signage + passenger conveyor belt budgets went to the art/deco department. Who wouldn't like to be visually stimulated by random chic art when it's 100f+ degrees outside  in the shade while you are dragging your luggage around?Pros:Free wifi.",During
358," How this airport is 5 stars, I don't know. Maybe people actually don't go to 4-5 star airports like Singapore, Dubai, San Francisco, etc. Not one of my fav airports. While it's pretty easy to navigate, I hate them at CLEAR is just at one security check point so you have to walk from one end of the airport to Che k in to the other side to go through CLEAR and back to the other side for your gate. It's an inconvenience. I heard other people complain the TSA check point line took longer than the regular line. There's a really musty smell at this airport likely from the heat and poor ac ventilation; it reminds me of airports in other countries. The food here is not that appetizing and there are barely any outlets. Overall a pretty average airport compared to others.",During
359," Easy to navigate airport. TSA line moved fairly quickly. Biggest downside is the lack of dining options for early morning; not everyone wants a fully cooked meal or a rock hard cold muffin, a middle ground between the two would be wonderful. Overall, a nice, mid-sized airport.",During
360," We live here and i get offering Austin resources but Austin Java needs to be replaced. There is zero service, slow lines. Pastries were just not fresh did not even want one. Skipped coffee. Food is very TX, you really need more offerings. Not everyone wants tacos in the morning. At least a McDonalds would have coffee i could get on the go. You need more food kiosks. Currently in Denver and it is a *real* airport. Disaapointed. Get your coffee before you get here.",During
361," Enjoying my wait for my connecting flight to San Diego at a bar at the airport!!! The right way if you ask me! It's 9:40pm and a taco and beer taste great! Even with the construction 10 feet away! What a taco and beer can do! LolNot too many places open at this hour.  But, I will say some thing, I would rather be on a delayed flight knowing that I am on a vacation traveling to see my sister and her family!!!",During
362," This is a small airport so it allows for minimal stress and confusion when you are navigating your way to the gate or if you have a connection.Although it is a small airport they have multiple security checkpoints that are closer to the different gates which, I believe, keeps the security lines to a minimum. I think I got through the security line in about 15 minutes with a handful of people in front of me.The gate I was at had multiple seats that had outlets built into it which was nice. I really hate when airports have the one charging station per gate or if I have to sit on the floor to use a stray outlet. So having these seats was a nice touch!",During
368," I like this airport. Easy layout, some good food choices and security checks don't take forever. The air conditioning works and the bathrooms are clean.Gates have lots of seats with multiple charging stations. Sometimes there's live music in the terminal or in one of the cafes.It's easy to find a cab, grab a ride share or get a car rental. Not a large, overwhelming airport...it's just right.",During
369, I have only been to this location a couple of times but the experience has always been pleseant. Easy airport to get around and the security isn't too bad. The KCM line for employees moves quickly as well!Lots of shops and eating places before and after security.Safe travels!!,During
370," A modern and comfortable airport. It gets pretty crowded and Austin area has already outgriwn the facility, much like the rest if the citys infrastructure",During
371," Traveling through so many airports its alway good to come, to a quaint yet busy airport. I have to say that this ones right in the middle. I like it because its small and its pretty clear where you need to go. The staff is helpful for the most part and then you also have some small shops that are nice to go to when its not too hectic. I think the parking still needs some work but it is still usable. Im sure ill be back to fly from here. Until then, have a great flight.",During
372, Whole airport smells like homeless people use it to go to the bathroom. Yes Austin your airport smells like piss!,During
373," I've flown in and out of Austin once or twice a year for the past 5 years and I haven't experienced inconvenience once. Let's put this into perspective: I compare every airport to LAX and London Heathrow which are the worst in my mind. Baggage claim is decorated with giant guitars with different art on each one. Both top and bottom floors have funky stores with Austin's slogan: ""Keep Austin Weird"". It can't be Austin without healthy food options and BBQ. I don't recommend getting the BBQ at the airport though, it's not worth it. Airport security has always been easy unless it's prime flying time but again, nothing compares to LAX or Heathrow lol (can you tell I've been through some crazy times?)",During
374, This airport is clean and small-medium size; we were here in Oct 2016 upon arrival to Austin - lots of Texas souvenirs available. Hertz is located nearby (walking distance) for easy rental car pick-up.,During
375, Well I hit a lot of airports in my travels as I roll around the country and this is a real nice simple airport easy in Easy out for me and everything work real smooth so what can I say but good things it was easy to be found for pickup it was easy to get whatever I needed while inside that secured area and as usual you get in a nice walk as the size of planes in the size we are ports forces us to get that little bit of extra exercise as we walk from one end of the universe to the other. You can't hold that against the airport that's just the nature of the Beast and I'm happy to be able to do it,During
376," I love Austin's airport and it's only grown larger and larger over the last few years, expanding dining options, seating areas, adding additional airline gates, etc.  The airport always seems clean and organized and I feel quite comfortable in it. I particularly love when they have live bands, as they sometimes do to welcome people to the live music capital of the world! Fun place to fly in or out of!",During
377, They have changed everything. Rental cars are upstairs and have new doors when you come up. Much more organized  like Dallas and New York. It's not as confusing as Los Angeles . Heard they are getting rid of the restaurant upstairs and putting something new in.,During
378, Good airport. Liked the fact that they are building an expansion to airport and have a new parking garage. Music was playing when I landed so it made me feel good. The baggage carousels seemed to take over an half hour to start spitting out our bags.,During
384," Austin airport is quite easy to get in and out.Upon arriving, rental car is located just across the street. No need to take a shuttle bus. I never check my bag when traveling on business but when I had to wait for others bad to arrive, checked bags came out fairly fast.Coming back, a gas station is so close to the airport. One time I forgot to fill the gas so I went out of the airport again but I managed to comeback quickly and didn't miss my flight.Airport is small enough to navigate easily. I found a few restaurants I liked here, burger (where they serve organic food, but I can't remember the name) and BBQ from salt lick.My only complaint is weather, nothing to do with airport design or friendly staff. In the afternoon, when thunderstorms come by, airport is shut down. I sat there as long as 6 hours one time, waiting for my flight. When planning trips in the summer, I always keep that in mind for possible weather delays.",During
385," Decent airport, cute local food options.If you're here super early Maudie's Tex mex has grab and go breakfast tacos, they come with a little side of salsa. Skip the Salt Lick not worth it.Security checkpoint 3 always has a shorter line than 1 or 2!",During
386," Every time I land here at night (past 10 PM, which has happened 4 or 5 times due to plane delays) no one is ever ready to receive the arriving planes so we sit at the runway for half an hour to an hour. It reminds me of the line that Meryl Streep says in The devil wears Prada, ""Why is no one ready?"" Also the floors always smell like a wet mop or laundry that has been left in the wash for too long, I always gag when I arrive. They need to change their floor cleaner water or use bleach. On the plus side, easy to drive in and security checkpoints are pretty fast.",During
387, Landed at 4:15pm after a week long trip. Ready to get home. It is now 5pm and the belt just started turning. There is absolutely no excuse in a tiny airport like this one to make your clients wait 45 minutes for their bags...unacceptable!,During
388," Cool little airport.  My first visit here was rough.  Not because of the airport but because American Airlines effed me up ROYALLY.  And when you're at the airport at 6 am and there is a 30 person line for hte only eatery, well, it sucks.  The next time I was here I flew united.  No issues.  Just a smooth security process, a lovely stop for a foot massage and a lot more eateries open at 2 pm.  Plenty of seating at the gate and clean bathrooms.  Easy to navigate airport with live music.  Eateries are good.  Shopping stinks.",During
389, Good airport with a fair variety of food. There is a new and larger Salt Lick BBQ restaurant being built at Gate 12.  Rental car garage is a bit of a walk from the terminal. Admirals Club is a bit small for the amount of traffic it sees.,During
390," This is one of my favorite airports, right up there with Dallas Love and London Gatwick. It's clean, has great restaurants, plenty of space to sit and wait and fun interesting artwork. Plus the staff are friendly - just what you'd expect from a welcoming city like Austin!",During
391," Came to Austin airport after 12+ years for an old friends reunion.  The airport looks different now.  There are more eateries than before.  Bathrooms were clean.  Bags came quickly.  Did not try the parking, so no comments on that.I would have given 4 stars.  But taking down 1 star for poor seating capacity.  On the return there were storms in Texas and most of the flights were delayed.  Every seat was taken and still plenty of people were standing around.",During
392, Flying Delta headed back to MN for work. Great Airport quick in and out ...quick check in and all gates are relatively close especially anything to your right as you get through security. Drop off and pick up is pretty fast as well...not a major hub.,During
393, Super nice airport. Not overly large but nice. Can get very busy!,During
399," Easy in, easy out. Lots of Austin food favorites here like Salt Lick BBQ. So if you don't have enough time to eat before coming here... you have plenty of options!I liked that there were plenty of charging stations near the terminals. Not much else to say, but enjoyed the short amount of time I had here!PS. When we came, there was no Uber or Lyft. The transport options here (Fasten and RideAustin) are EXPENSIVE in comparison. Consider renting a car instead if you're here for  a few days.",During
400," By far, one of the best airports to navigate in the United States. There are several locations where you can get information or assistance, great selections for food, live music, and a quaint feel despite being in a busy city. The three security checkpoints keep the line waits to a minimum which keeps your stress level low. The airport offers a great network of domestic flights with an increasing number of flights to Europe. Keep up the great work, AUS!",During
401," What the heck is going on around here today! This is my city and I have always been so proud of the people and the sense of camaraderie we share. Not feeling it today at the airport for sure!. From the woman behind the check-in counter at Southwest, to the women working Salt Lick's Taco Bar and the woman behind the bar at Ray's we have gotten nothing but stony faces. I'm sorry you're not as happy as I am about me going on vacation but it certainly would be more enjoyable to think that you were!I do have to say that the check-in guy with TSA was jovial and a breath of fresh air!!",During
402," Been to this airport quite a few times within the last 1 1/2- and I absolutely love it! It's actually my favorite. For starters, it is small; just one terminal which makes it extremely easy to find wherever you need to go. I am from New Jersey- so I know all about the chaos other airports have going on. This place is a breath of fresh air for a traveler (both coming and going).Going through security is never a hassle, and all of the TSA workers here are really nice.  I love how the airport has local ATX food joints inside (which I think is important for people to know who have layovers or connecting flights!). The food is pretty darn good I must say. They also have live music inside which I think is pretty cool. One of the few airports that make you feel like you are officially in that state/area. They also have a lot of shops- just in case any of you need to pick up something from a friend, child, family member etc. Until next time! For the rest of you, safe travels!!!",During
403, Finding yummy veggie food that's not too deep fried is always a great anxiety at any airport especially in the USA but Austin kicks ass. If you're Hindu or have an allergy to food that causes heart attacks or just love great food there's this whole entire area of the airport just for you.,During
404," One of the best airports in the US if you can get past the limited flight options to other non-Texas cities. Once you can, fly in and out of this airport and you'll enjoy fast security lines and some great Texas food options like tacos and BBQ. In fact, as you enjoy good food, there's usually live music as well. How cool is that?!",During
405," While most of the shops and operations aren't bad at Bergstrom, the baggage handling operation is a dumpster fire. 30 minutes after getting off the plane, still no bags. Pretty ridiculous.",During
406, Easy airport. Just make sure you go through the security check point to the very far left otherwise you will be in line for quite a while.,During
407," Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to me is nowhere on the level of a standard international airport, but that is what makes it great! Small in size, but very quaint and extremely easy to navigate. Of course being Texas, the airport hosts some tasty treats, but nothing near as good as what you would find in the city itself. If you are indeed dying for some BBQ, salt lick will hold you over until a later meal. Security is a breeze and they do a wonderful job keeping the line moving. Keep in mind being a smaller airport during the busy hours, lines may get long, but will move quickly. For Virgin America frequent flyers, rejoice as this airport is one of their non stop offerings (Key for my SFO flights). To sum it up, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is one my favorite airports in the country.",During
408, I have been traveling a lot lately and I must say that Austin-Bergstrom Airport is always clean! When going thru security it has been smooth each time. They all have been friendly and helpful !,During
414, So happy to leave this city the tsa is a joke super rude went to check  some luggage and the rep wasn't there took us almost an hour to get through security for some reason they wouldn't let us walk through the metal detector instead we had to get a full body pat down never again will I come to this mind numbing void,During
415, Pretty great smaller airport. Lots of food and shopping options. Security is fast and rental cars aren't too far way.,During
416," We love the Austin airport!  My review today is about my experience with their long term parking option.  We've traditionally parked off site to be shuttled in thinking that was the best option.  Not anymore!  They had several employees directing traffic which led us quickly to our spot and the bus picked us up in less than a minute.  The driver was very courteous and we were at our gate shortly.  Plus, I think it's only $7 per day.  We'll be back!!",During
417," What pleasant and helpful parking staff. This airport is so well organized. You are directed to the closest parking spot, given a ticket with the parking lot number to keep, and transported to the terminal efficiently. I left my phone in my car after checking my luggage and a shuttle driver took me right to my parking area and waited for me and returned me to the airport! The whole feel of this airport is relaxed and helpful from parking, check in, security, to the gate staff!",During
418," One of my favorite airports. Low stress, short waits, easy to navigate. I wish driving around town was this easy.Happy travels!",During
419," This review is about the new ""south"" terminal which isn't listed separately so i need to rate the airport. I'm not sure what idiot designed this, buts it about 10 miles (no joke) and a 15 min drive from the main terminal and rental cars. It's like you are flying into another town. It is the worst airport design I've seen in my life. I'm shocked anyone Thought of this. Between waiting for a bus and he drive, add 45 minutes for this idiocy.",During
420," Great little airport for an explosive city. The expand with the times. Rarely wait very long, even when the lines are. Always have nice interesting art. Salt Lick to go!",During
421," The more I travel, the more I appreciate this airport. Security lines move reasonably well. While the current construction around here is a drag, this airport is pretty darn easy to navigate. If you are heading west 71 is practically to the airport now. Heck, the local roads around here are a lot more congested.Nice cell lot can be tricky to find  get out. Long term parking is currently only $7/day and less than 30 minutes is free.",During
422, Traveling as much as I do all airports start to look the same after awhile. I like Austin's airport because it's easily laid out and clearly marked. No trams and all on one level is a huge plus. It's small enough where you don't have to walk forever to get to your gate but large enough to offer a variety of dining and drinking choices. The restaurants feature local Austin BBQ (Salt Lick) and such. Depending on the time of day they have TSA checkpoints open at both ends of the airport. Many people don't realize this and therefore the line gets long. The Saxony Bar and Grill had a live band setting up the last time I was here. They also have reasonable drink prices. $10 for a margarita at an airport bar is pretty damn good!,During
423, Quick and easy airport to get in and out Of for travel. However its a super busy airport so arrive early if you're not precheck.,During
424," Smaller with personality!This is a small airport with easy to navigate and well marked directions.  The funky, lighthearted decorations reflect the culture and personality of Austin.  Fee wifi, of course!    The staff were also really quick with baggage which was really helpful!!Love the guitars at baggage claim!",During
430," I enjoy the airport and frequently fly in and out. It's big enough, but yet small enough with crowds that it isnt too hectic. My only issues with the airport is that the TSA precheck line is in the middle at checkpoint 2. If you walk in near 1 or three, you have to walk a ways to get to the precheck. It might be more convenient sometimes to skip precheck and go with everyone else, but I pay for the convenience. It's so nice to not take my flaps off, pull my laptop out, put everything in the bin, redress and put my laptop back in my bag. In and out of the line in a few minutes. No hassle, no nasty pay down by creepers, and no intrusive body scanner. I also think the airport should put in some people mover escalators to move everyone faster through the concourses and to the gates. It can get crowded, but with Austin being a 'healthy' city, I don't think they'll want that",During
431," tons of Texas-themed goodies to bring home, including the world famous Salt Lick BBQ which always has the longest line of any shop or restaurant in the airport. I've seen people dropping hundreds of dollars buying ribs and sides to bring homegood variety of local restaurants and some with live music which is cool",During
432," I've been here a few times and I don't have any complaints about this place yet. I have to echo/agree with others that there is a good collection of dining options and it is not a terrible walk from any gate out to the baggage claim and onto ground transportation. The airport is not confusing, being basically a single building. Add to that the fact that it is pretty close to downtown, so you're not spending half your trip in a cab. This review wouldn't be complete without another shout out to Salt Lick. Too bad my flight leaves godawful early this trip so I won't be able to partake. :'(",During
433," This is a very good airport because of the following - - Free WiFi- Lots of dining options (Salt Lick)- Clean bathrooms and clean overall- Comfortable seating at gates (I can say this for United flights)- Baggage claim went smoothly and there wasn't a long wait for bags- Easy to navigate to where you need to go (baggage claim, transportation, car rental, etc.)- Curbside check-in- Smooth security process- Live music? Yes, live music. Two thumbs up and five-stars for this airport!",During
434," This airport is easy to maneuver and it's impossible to get lost. There's plenty of seating room, a few good choices in food and the staff is friendly.Just follow your signs overhead and you'll make your way around just fine. Come to the airport 2 hours prior to departure as TSA can be lengthy at times. You know the drill.",During
435, Unfortunately we encountered changes in our itinerary due to unforeseen situations.  Allianz Global provided guidance and directions for reimbursement.  We received our refunds in less than two weeks.  One of the simplest solutions I have experienced.  I choose Allianz in all my travels.  5 Stars and Two Thumbs Waaayyyyyy Up!,During
436, Lame as hell. I can't believe it's the only Airport that doesn't have a USO for theMilitary.,During
437," As airports go, this one is pretty good! Small, short security lines, lots of local food and coffee options, live music. Everything you need without the stresses of larger airports! Visit Austin.",During
438, One of the easiest airport experiences I have ever had. Traveled out on a Sunday and the lines were short and moved quickly.Everything is very clean and most terminals have places to charge your phone. No need to show up super early for your flight like most airports. It's a breeze!,During
439," AUS is my favorite non-hub airport in the US. Its one terminal design means you can enter via any security checkpoint and grab food at any restaurant. Speaking of food, there are some pretty reasonable eats. And live entertainment! It's surprising how small AUS is for a city that's got as much going on as Austin but it gets the job done.",During
445, Clean and efficient! I like airports that aren't ridiculously complicated to get around or have miles long walks just to get to the curb or baggage claimDownside is that everyone seems to smoke a lot by the curb and there isn't a designated smoking area. Salt lick BBQ has a location in here for last minute BBQ before your flight!,During
446," No issues here (aside from the lack of competitive rideshare options), plus Amy's Ice Cream and live music.",During
447, Valet services has changed everything and it's no longer convenient at all. Now leave your car across breezeway so you might as well park yourself. AND when you pick up you go downstairs to get bags just to haul them upstairs and back across breezeway. NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE.,During
448, Easy access from terminal to baggage claim after a long walk from the plane to the terminal. Very clean and  new. Bags came out quickly. Very friendly staff including officers. Passenger pick up directly adjacent to baggage claim. Car rental companies a little walk but on site. The airport is only about 15-20 minutes from downtown.,During
449, This airport has a long walk from car rental to terminal.  Signs are not clear.  Restaurants close at 7pm!!!!!  Bathroom is not clean.  Very boring small airport.  I would not fly here if I can help it.,During
450, Easy parking. Fast shuttle service. My only mistake was wearing bling on my pants which called for extra screening. Overall easy check in.,During
451," I love how small the Austin airport is, yet you can still find really great deals on flights. On more than one occasion, I have found myself traveling to Austin from SA, saving up to $600 on a RT flight! I typically never park at airport parking lots. I just assume the closer, covered lots are way too expensive and the economy lots are a bajillion miles away with sketchy shuttle service that doesn't run often enough. Well, I was mistaken. On my last trip up to fly out of Austin, I had a 6am flight and arrived at the airport parking lot a little after 5am. I chose economy lot C (the closest uncovered lot, $7/day). I thought it might be hard to find but you can actually put any of the lots into Google Maps and it'll take you right to the entrance! Easy peasy. You can even save trees by inserting the same credit card upon entry and exit so it doesn't have to print you a ticket. Once I got into the actual parking lot area, there were guys directing traffic so I didn't have to circle around for forever looking for an open spot. I also wasn't sure how long it'd take me to get to the terminal. I wasn't too too worried since I had TSA precheck and also had only a backpack and no checked bags, but it was my first time parking there and I wasn't sure of the whole shuttle situation. They say that the shuttles run continuously, but how continuously was continuously? Well, turns out you pretty much don't have to wait. At all. Okay, maybe like 1 minute at the most? Oh, and the parking spots are very clearly numbered and sections are clearly labeled. I jotted down my section and spot number in my phone notes app and spotted the shuttle just a few feet away. There are shuttle stops pretty much every few rows so you won't have to walk far at all. The shuttle driver will ask you what airline you're flying, and before you know it, you'll be at the check-in counter. Time from entering parking lot to arriving at terminal: somewhere around 6-10 minutes. Given that Austin has such amazing food, I think their airport could do better with its food selection. I had a Salt Lick brisket sandwich there once, and if the legit thing from the original location is a 10/10, whatever concoction they served up at the airport was no more than a 1.5/10. Blasphemy. Oh, but at 5am, they did have a little Cuvee coffee bar with what seemed like free coffee (donations accepted). This was right next to a Benefit vending machine, haha. All your necessities in one place. Anyway, the airport is clean enough, security is a breeze (it's not a high risk airport so if you have TSA pre, you literally don't have to take anything out of your bag!), and it's teeny tiny so you don't have to worry about different terminals or trains or any of that. There are also these random touch screen interactive game things at some of the gates. Fun for the bored and delirious (aka me at 5am). On my way back, I exited the airport and first thing I saw was a sign for the shuttle to the parking lots. Got in line and the shuttle was there in seconds. You call out your section number that you conveniently pull up in your iPhone notes section and bada bam, before you know it, you're back at your car and on your way home. P.S. Random and not really related to the review, but on my way to my car, I passed by another car where the backseat door was ajar-- maybe 3-4 inches. From what I could tell, there was no one in the car, no lights on, nothing. I was tempted to close the door, but the entire thing looked sketchy and I didn't want to get kidnapped/murdered, ya know? Plus, it was almost midnight. So I just called up the airport parking office and gave them the section and spot # so they could check on the car. Not sure if someone just left in a hurry and forgot to shut their car door? Or if there were shenanigans involved and found an unlocked car door? Either way, just use common sense... Be aware of your surroundings, keep your valuables out of sight, and lock your car. The parking lot felt very safe in general, and it looked like security was patrolling the area. So thank you, Austin airport, for existing and saving my wallet when one of my dream residency programs offered me an interview with 36 hours notice! You pretty much rock.",During
452," With the hassle of going through airports as much as we do it was refreshing to have a nice clean, easy and modern experience.The only negative is Waze GPS gets you lost.Now off to LAX we go which is torture.",During
453," I love that we have such a small easy to use airport! Easy in, easy out. Love the cell phone waiting area so you don't have to drive in circles waiting to pick people up. They also have good local food that you cam get in Austin on your way out of you forgot to eat at one of your favorite places. I think Ruta Maya coffe is still in  there which is great for early morning flights.",During
454, It's an airport. What kind of asshole feels the need to seriously rate an airport. It's not like there are competing airports here.,During
456,],During
461," We missed our flight because apparently no one works at the counter and their kiosks don't work.  We were here with more than plenty of time, but because of their lack of ANY assistance, we were rerouted to American whose kiosks weren't much better and didn't let us check in, after waiting in their horrendous lines forever, because there wasn't ""enough time.""  Now we're on our second standby because of their negligence.",During
462," This review is for the ABIA parking customer service.I'm a frequent traveler in/out of ABIA (about 4.5M miles over the past 15 years) and I always use the onsite parking garage/lots.  Last night, I arrived back to Austin after being out of town for a couple of days and when I went to pick up my car from the parking area I found that my battery was dead.  I called the main number for ABIA parking to request a battery jump.  The lady that responded (I did not get her name) was very friendly and promptly sent Ron to help.  Ron arrived very quickly, hopped out of his truck with a smile on his face and helped me to get my car started.  He was very professional, positive, and personable.    It took a few minutes, but he got my car jumped and I thought I was on my way.   Well, my car died again and Ron quickly returned and spent about 30 minutes trying to help me get my car started. During the entire process, Ron was extremely professional, courteous, and focused on helping.   He turned a frustrating event into a positive experience.  I can't thank ABIA enough for having people like Ron supporting customers the airport customers.",During
463," I definitely love traveling and have been to quite a lot of airports. I have to say Austin's airport is one of the nicest ones I've been to and experienced! The airport is really clean and modern looking, and everyone we've encountered including TSA were super nice and friendly to us! Flying in and out of Austin was super smooth, and there wasn't a huge crowd both times we were at the airport. I love that there is SUCH a variety of places to eat and goto while you're waiting. I didn't have the chance to try any of their restaurants because we had dinner beforehand, but I have to say a nice and clean airport with helpful staff is always an awesome experience. There are a lot of seats in the seating area as well while you wait for your flight. Overall, one of my favorite airports that I've visited recently, and will definitely be making multiple trips to Austin again!",During
464," Austin has a pretty nice airport, once you get in.  Shame there's no easy way it or out without getting a cab or a rental, but once you're there it's pretty nice.  As others have mentioned, there's always live music going on each afternoon in the center of the concourse and plenty of Texas-style places to eat.One downside: the explosion of quick bites, food courts, and easy food pop-ups does not translate to a proportional number of sit-down restaurants with bars.  In one of the biggest cowboy airport capitols, you may be hard pressed to find a place you can sit and have a beer...",During
465," When I moved to Austin 3 yrs ago I was surprised to find such a small airport for a ever growing city. I love that the airport is just one terminal making it easy to get from one side to the next.  I love that there is ALWAYS live music playing somewhere.  I enjoy the free wifi that always works well and the auto water refill stations. There are also lots of places to charge your phone.  There are 3 security checkpoints, and they now have clearly marked wait times, so you can take a walk and get in another line that is shorter.  That happened to me today - went from check point one that was a 15-19 minute wait to check point three that was listed as 5 minutes and got through in 3 min.   While the food tries to highlight local places, they could really do a better job.  This seems to be something they are working on as they now have a great wine bar - vino volo, and 2nd Bar  Kitchen will have a spot opening sometime in the near future. The transportation to the airport sucks.  There isn't really any great routes. They all get clogged.  While there is a bus that connects the airport to downtown, it's just OK service.There are very few international flights that leave from this airport.  It does seem like we are getting more domestic direct routes leaving from Austin, including international.  Love the British Airways flight to London from here.For an airport Austin is clean and seems cheerful to me. It is one of the better airports I have been too.",During
466," Dorothy was right when she said, ""There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.""Airports generally give me anxiety, what with their endless lines, nonsensical processes, and unpredictable invasions of privacy and dignity. ABIA does this to me, too, but I still like it best compared to other airports because, of course, it's my home base. Conde Nast even ranked it as #9 of the best airports in the U.S., so they must be doing something right! Some of the things I love most about ABIA:- Quick entry  exit. I never spend as much time in line at ABIA as I do in any other airport.- Live ""Music in the Air"" from 1:00-5:30p weekday at 5 alternating stages; see the lineup here austintexas.gov/departme…- Benson's Roadhouse, with a life-sized cutout of Ray Benson for photo-ops- Artwork throughout the facility, but especially the statue of Barbara Jordan and the mosaic map of downtown Austin in the floor near baggage claim; see more at austintexas.gov/departme…- Breakfast tacos from Maudie's  Nuevo Leon; find the food here: austintexas.gov/sites/de…- Ruta Maya  Austin Java coffee - mmmmmmm- Cool Austin-y gift  apparel at almost every shop; find the shops here: austintexas.gov/sites/de…- Nonstop flights to almost anywhere I need to go, with new international destinations being added regularly: austintexas.gov/departme…- Park Perk program, which beats the prices  convenience of most of the 3rd party parking places around the airport (except around the holidays  peak travel periods when ABIA's lots get full): austintexas.gov/departme…If you travel regularly through ABIA, be sure to follow them on social media for alerts of interest, such as special parking deals, construction updates, notices of full garages, special events, etc.",During
467," I love our airport :) I do wish it were bigger sometimes- mostly to add more food choices haha we're a bit limited in that department.However, everyone here always seems to have their shit together, and I like that!Always clean, easy to navigate, friendly staff.",During
468, Easy in and easy out! No hassle arriving and no hassle coming back in. Security is fast and the checkpoint isn't hard at all and I was travelling during peak Thanksgiving time. Good place and as a lot of great food places around here. Go to check point 2 if you want to be closer to gates 10-12 etc,During
469, I haven't had any problems at the airport everyone it's always very helpful and you go through security very quick.,During
470," Yes, it's an airport.  Planes fly in and planes fly out.  This is a single building airport with 25 gates strung lengthwise and around the ends of the somewhat narrow terminal floor.  With 3 TSA (totally screwed access) check points, getting through hasn't been an issue for me on my many trips in and out.Once passed security, there's not a lot to do ... sit, eat, drink, charge ... pretty much the same as other airports.  Love the $2 self serve honor system coffee carts in the terminal area.  Rental car lots are (mostly) directly across from the terminal building.  No need for a shuttle to get to your rental.One of the easier in and out airports I've been through.",During
476," Ok it's he day before thanksgiving and this place is crazy packed.... security kind, friendly smiling and 3 minute wait. The best experience I've had at this airport or any airport in a long time. You guys stepped your game up today. Thank you for making this trip pleasant!",During
477," Parking here is easy and decently priced. The short-term garage: $23/day. The close-in lot (A): $11/day. The further out lost (B-J or so): $7/day. The $7/day is cheaper than the private parking companies nearby like Parking Spot, and there's more than ample parking close to each shuttle stop. Just park, wait like two seconds, and a shuttle will take you to check-in for your airline in a 5 minute or less drive.Downsides: Wi-Fi is only free for a limited time and there are only I believe two options for food before security. Upsides: Pretty much everything else. Lots of local food options (and very few chains), some great bookshops and Austin-themed gift shops, live music, etc.Pro-Tip: The bathrooms behind the baggage carousels are way cleaner and less busy than the ones upstairs by the gates.",During
478," Wow, a big, clean and easy to navigate airport. I thought this airport was a lot bigger than it was because there was sooo much space in the airport!! However, there is really only one terminal, with 30 gates, and a handful of airlines. It's not crowded at all and everything moves fast. I don't know how much parking here is, but I saw lots of cheap offsite parking while going here. We flew in from California and rented a car. Their car rental section is HUGE!!! It's across the street from the airport and 4 stories high!! I liked that all the car rental places were in one place because I hate taking the car rental shuttles as sometimes it's such a hassle. Everything looked brand new and super clean. On each floor, there is between 3-4 car rental companies... so that is ALOT of cars if you need one!Checking in, we flew JetBlue and it was really quick and easy. Going through security only took about 5 minutes which left us over an hour to grab lunch at the airport and relax. The airport however, does seem to be in the middle of nowhere with just 2 gas stations that I saw. So if you are in a rental car, fill up your gas before returning your car. Also, if there is something in Austin foodwise, that you really wanted to try or grab to eat at the airport, do so before getting to the airport because there is literally nothing around the airport but dirt and grass! Also note that many of the typical national chains you see in other airports are not here - meaning no McDonalds, no Starbucks, etc. If that's what you really want, grab it before. In this airport, there is Amy's Ice Cream, Salt Lick BBQ, a pizza place, a Mexican place, the every airport newsstand and snack shop, and I believe some more local coffee place.",During
479," The airport is fine. Wifi is a bit spotty, but the airport as a whole isn't too packed, the security lines aren't terrible, and there is a decent selection of shops showcasing local foods and goods.If you're like me and hoping to find a Starbucks on your way out to pick up an Austin mug, sorry, you're out of luck.",During
480," A little grimy and slow, but overall it was ok.  Per usual expensive food and drink options, a lot of junk food.  I do like the 1.75 bus fare to downtown, by pillar #4, that comes every 1/2 hour.  The airport is perfectly serviceable.",During
481," I am a business traveler and have been in and out of this airport weekly for the last 2.5 months.  a few complaints here.  although they have remodeled and the car rental section is nice,  it is incredibly hard to find the first time you drive to it.  I went around 3 times before I found the weird little turnout area. the signage could be MUCH better.  I feel like I half to walk a mile to get to the car rental port from the terminal.  I HATE it. just tonight 11/3/2016 around 730pm at terminal 2, a female TSA agent was literally barking at me and one other girl who were the only ones ready to go through the scanner. in the most CONDESCENDING tone she says ""no liquids in the bags,  oh come on ladies! you KNOW you got some sprays in your luggage"". now that doesnt seem irrational HOWEVER,  the aggressiveness and tone was downright  disrespectful to the point that me and the other lady look at eachother and I say ""wow, she's really being a b*tch"" and she agreed wholeheartedly. we felt like children being scolded who are incapable of following flying directions as she ASSUMED. and frankly I thought it was sexiest for her to ""assume"" that I carry chemical - laden feminine sprays. she disgusted me.  her attitude was piss poor and maybe she had to puff up her little bird chest to prove something to the men.  anyways. ....the pre board line up area is really crappy!  they are portioned into 5 people per slot and  the numbers are confusing to where there's always multiple people standing in the wrong spot who are technically supposed to board behind me. why bother checking in on time to reserve a earlier boarding time to only get pushed back?  it's crowded and people are breathing down your neck! I also hate the fact that the resturaunts close around 7pm and there is no vegan or vegetarian friendly options considering this is a progressive city!   poor shopping stores as well. the lighting is horrible with bright fluorescent lights directly overhead that enhances everybody's tired features. not a place I want to spend any more time than I have to",During
482, Took an hour to get through security at 5am. Most people missed their flights due to the airport and TSA's incompetence.Worse than LAX.,During
483," ABIA has exceeded my expectations and I'm great full for consistent service of great food, shops and bathrooms. The environment is friendly and diverse. I'm proud to call this my Home Airport.",During
484, I've never had any problems here and I have made it to the airport only an hr before take off (which I don't suggest) during morning rush hour !! Still made it too. So I'm glad that the lines move smoothly here and all restrooms are usually clean.,During
485," One of the best airports ever. Really easy to get in and out of, and inside, relatively small for a city this size. Unfortunately, headed back to the land of no breakfast tacos.",During
491," I can only comment on my arrival experience. The terminal and bathrooms are modern and very clean. I saw many interesting eateries on the way out. It was a short walk from gate to to baggage claim area. When we got there, our luggages were already during the merry-go-round routine, efficient. The city bus station was just outside the doors, convenient. A downtown and University of Texas dedicated bus swings by every half hour. $1.75 will get you the ride, free for college students, inexpensive. We did such a fast get away on the bus, happy. I don't have any security and Wi-Fi experience yet, stay tune.",During
492," Usually, if I'm at the airport it's because I'm off for a fun and exciting (or maybe just a work related) adventure ~or~ I'm coming home and happy about it! Most of the time I'm at the airport, its a positive experience. Here are a few of the things I like about the Austin airport:-The display of Austin's sister cities-The rotating art displays-Live music-Mostly local eateries and shops-The mirrors in the ladies rooms that have the big Texas hair etched in (I always try to line my head up to see what I would look like with a bouffant)-My favorite, friendliest TSA agent you will ever encounter, Agent McBroom-The water bottle filling stations that tell me how many plastic bottles have been saved-The lactation station pod for nursing moms-The art guitars",During
493," Small airport, but they are pretty efficient in getting people through lines and security. I like that once you get through security and into the terminal, all of their businesses are local places. They have different places playing live music and you can order a Texas beer while listening. Couple of book stores and general merchandise stores as well. Austin airport is generally much more expensive than the San Antonio airport...so if you can make the drive down there, it will usually save a pretty substantial amount of money.",During
494, Avoid checkpoint 2.  Less security machines. Sloooow. Go to other security checkpoints. Fasten to the airport $10 less than a cab. Eat before you arrive as the dining options are limited.,During
495," Needs better Wi-Fi ConnectionNot sure if it's the Stormy Weather causing poor connection but when your stuck for a few hours, good Wi-Fi connection helps make time go by quicker.",During
496," This is one of the best airports I've ever used. It's easy to return a rental car. The signage is well done. I didn't have to take a shuttle from the rental car area to the airport. Awesome !The security check points provide lots of info with big signs for those of us who are TSA pre-checked. There is even a digital sign that says ""10min wait at this point"". They even have a live band within a eatery where you can order drinks! The music wasn't bad as well.The gates are well organize with lots of food choices nearby.My only criticism, seats in the waiting are don't have outlets! Otherwise it's a modern, well organized airport, one of the best in the country from my experience.",During
497," Nice large airport. Not massive distance wise but large specially. Plenty of food, coffee, massage places, bars etc. Ample seating at gates.",During
498," Think about the last time you were able to de-plane and pick up a rental car, assuming no checked baggage, and leave the airport in less than 30 minutes? In Austin, you can do that, especially if you are flying the Denver to Austin Southwest route. That fact alone deserves a 5-star rating.What Austin has in accessibility it lacks a bit in modern touches. The bathrooms are from the mid-90's. The food choices are somewhat limited. The WIFI is operated by gerbils in a wheel behind the ticket counters. Only half of the electrical outlets work, and of those, only half are able to hold the plug without fashioning some sort of hokey positioning device.Even with all of that, the airport is fantastic. You shouldn't be sitting in this airport longer than a couple of hours anyway. Go explore the city, and then navigate the difficulties of the airport. Just keep in mind you'll be able to leave very quickly and probably still return before your flight takes off.",During
499," Austin needs a better system for cabs. We were assisted into Ray's cabs by the airport's ground transportation. It was terrible. It was a smoking cab and we were not even told before hand. This guy added an extra $10 to my bill and told inappropriate, racist and offensive jokes. Not to mention the cab stunk like a nasty ashtray. Trying to get my money back but of course, there is no way to report him except to call him directly. Terrible!less """,During
500," This airport couldn't be much easier to navigate. Everything feels very small and easy to get to. Lots of iconic Austin restaurants inside. I've used the long term parking and shuttle service quite a few times and never had a problem. It always goes pretty fast, there are always shuttles there to pick you up.",During
506, Always fly into Austin. Fun city to hang out at and its cheaper to fly to Austin. The airport is easy to go through. Never really a long wait to get through security. A lot of nice shops to get some souvenirs. The restaurants are pretty good. Grab a beer or coffee and relax till your flight boards,During
507," This is definitely one of my favorite airports due primarily to good short security lines, Salt Lick BBQ, and this being one of my favorite cities.",During
508," C'mon it's A-town ya'll. Honestly they did a good job with this airport. Not loaded with every chain eatery and has real Austin character.It can get really busy with the various festivals, events and such in the area. Or something it's just busy for no apparent reason, so I suggest you always check. We had a quick line through security but early in the morning the day before you were barely able to make it.Various Austin flavors like Salt Lick, etc. No mistaking you're anywhere else but central Texas once you land here :) Yeee-ha, I love it.",During
509," Love this airport! It's easy to get here via the 130 toll and I love that they have a cell phone waiting area. Now I don't have to circle around to wait to pick up people from the airport. Only downside right now is the construction on 71. So be sure to follow the signs to get into the airport and out of there. I'm sure 71 will look great once construction is complete, but in the meantime be safe!Also, there is construction going on at the airport and near the airport. They are working on terminal expansions inside the airport. Outside near the airport, another parking facility is being made called Park and Zoom. Looks like its opening Fall of 2016. The airport parking service will offer pet boarding services.There are always taxis and parking shuttles waiting to pick up passengers near the baggage claim area. They have kiosks that allow you to print your own boarding passes for all airlines near the door unless you want to walk to your airline to use their kiosk or stand in line. The kiosk is convenient! The people who work here are nice and while TSA may have a line for the security check they are organized. The line moves pretty quickly.I love how the food choices are local establishments. This makes it easier to pick a place to eat a quick meal.",During
510," Quaint little airport.  It has window everywhere so it is well illuminated.  I like this aspects, some airports are dark and dank, but AUS has bright character. They have plenty of little stores and shops to explore.  Best of all, they have lots of local food options (think BBQ).  Getting into and out of the airport is a snap.  I did have some challenges with TSA, it took a surprising 30 minutes.",During
511," This airport is neat. It offers easy access with a Conveniently located cell phone a lot. If you're picking up someone, you can have them text you. Once they retrieve their luggage, pick them up at the lower level and get outta there!",During
512," This airport is hard to leave and get to at night, the highways around are often undergoing construction with no directions explaining alternate routes to getting to the airport. The streets in the airport area itself are poorly lit and slightly confusing. I get that Austin is just beginning to expand/develop this airport since traffic to the city is growing rapidly, but it's not really safe and scares me a lot. Another issue with this airport is that direct flights are difficult to find to a lot of major cities because it's still a relatively small airport :( However, coming and going during the day time is a breeze. There are 3 security checkpoints and screens that let you know what the wait times are, I've never had longer than a 10 minute wait going through security which is AWESOME compared to every airport I fly out of otherwise. The TSA agents are some of the friendliest also.There's awesome food options here where you won't have to wait like you do at the establishments in the actual city: Salt Lick BBQ  Amy's Ice Cream to name two. The people who work at Amy's are patient, helpful and fun. I dig the art inside the airport as well.",During
513," It was a pretty okay airport except that it randomly smelled like urine, I guess.",During
514," As far as airports are concerned Austin's is among the best though it could use at least one additional security checkpoint. The airport is smaller and easily navigable. There are great food options e.g., Salt Lick and Amy's Ice cream and they frequently feature live music in the afternoons and evenings (it is Austin after all). Most rental car companies are conveniently located across from the terminals.",During
515," This goes to the airport parking. A couple years ago rates were reasonable (~$7/day) and now there's never enough parking...even on non-holidays! They divert parking traffic to the garage, which used to be a fancy option if you wanted covered parking at about $30/day. The past few times I had no choice and unfortunately got subjected to the ridiculously high rate! If you force divert your customers there due to construction and/or filled lots at least provide affordable alternative options instead of bleeding out people's wallets.",During
521," Easily one of my favorite airports and it's for so many different reasons:- Great restaurants. What are you in the mood for?  Pizza, BBQ, Mexican, Ice Cream, etc. They're all available and right when you come thru security. - Live Music!  And we're not talking about a pianist here either. Solid country music up on a stage!- Car Rental. It's attached to the airport, no crazy shuttle process to an offsite place. Saving you time!- SWA and AA. My 2 favorite airlines!",During
522, For a small airport this location was very good. Lots of food joints and souvenir shops. They offer free wifi which is another great benefit.,During
523," I am an unabashed fan of this airport. It's just the right size for me. Big enough that I can get decent rates and decent flights, including some direct flights, but not so big that it's a pain in the ass to get in or out of (Are you listening George Bush IAH?). It's my last taste of Austin before I fly to wherever in the world I'm going that month, and I treasure that last hour. And I've long since lost count of how many visitors to the city I've met at the bar that are happily surprised to see live music in the airport. It's a perfect touch to send people off with a good memory of Austin. I love the idea of local businesses being in the airport. I realize all airport food and goods are overpriced, but the service is better and it just feels homier to me. Also I like checking out new local artists at Waterloo right after I clear security and before I settle in at Saxon Pub or Annie's for a pre-flight drink. Or three. The cell phone lot is possibly my favorite thing. I fly very long distances, and when I'm coming home I don't want to spend one minute more than I have to in the airport, and now that the cell phone lot is in place we have a great system. I text her as soon as the wheels touch the tarmac, and she leaves our house. By the time I deplane and get my luggage she's usually just pulling in to the cell lot. I text her again and in 2 minutes she's pulling up and I'm hugging her and the day blossoms with joy! What could be better! The luggage handling system is fairly speedy for an airport this size. The ticketing agents are friendly and seem eager to help, and they have TSA pre check and Global Entry, both of which everyone who travels more than twice a year domestically or once overseas should have. It makes the arrival process soooooo much easier!There is an airport addition planned to start either late this year or early next year that will add something like 9 more gates, or about half again the capacity. I just hope they plan it right. I don't want to lose my cool Austin airport.",During
524, Austin is probably the only place in Texas that isn't completely dominated by rednecks. The airport is small in comparison to BWI and Dulles. The staff is friendly with their southern drawls and folksy small talk.,During
525," Austin's airport always feels like home when you come back. It's small, but nice. It has a lot of Austin-y foods inside so you get a treat before you leave on your flight. It has good air conditioning, and security checks are quick. I wish more airports could be like it.",During
526," For parking: upon arrival to the airport we were redirected for overflow parking from the economy lot. When the signs stopped we parked in the lot. We informed information and they confirmed where we parked was overflow economy and was the same rate. Upon departure the attendant overcharged us and said ""a lot of other people said the same thing, call the number and they will reimburse you."" Just called and they will not reimburse. I would not have paid upon departure if I was not going to be reimbursed. There were at least 8 things that could have been done to prevent this. Having an actual overflow, sign directing people to overflow, not using the word overflow to lead guests to short term, informing information, having an attendant, informing the clerk, allowing the clerk to reimburse... Just to name a few. I work in the service industry and own my mistakes. It's a damn good thing there are better parking spots coming.",During
527," Very cool airport that represents Austin well! Lots of art and a nice selection of restaurants and shops that keep you busy while you wait for your flight. The Salt Lick location is great--good sampling of their full menu, plus, you can pick up salsa, coolers of smoked meat, and small SL gifts in line for reasonable prices. Amy's Ice Cream and the other Austin favorite's have nice build outs that give you a good taste of Austin if you're just passing through. The stores have a wide variety of unique merchandise. Rental car return is right in the parking structure, so it was a short walk to our terminal after returning the car. No shuttle required. Awesome place to fly to or from!",During
528," I recently arrived and departed from Austin-Bergstrom Int'l Airport on a business trip from Miami.  The airport is clean, nicely laid-out and easy to navigate.  Getting through security on a Wednesday in the late morning was a breeze. I guess no one travels on a midday Wednesday.  All in all a nice airport.",During
529, Thundercloud sucks. Worst food I've had at the airport and they shorted me $10 on my change. Terrible.,During
530," The airport is quite small. Thats ok. The biggest suprise to me was there is not wifi in the airport, Damn it.Neither does the airport have any kind of resting lounge like others. If you have some indications you might fall sick in a while, I would say take some measures Call friends, relatives to come help you.I was feeling uneasy while heading to airport, and I feel a little sick sooner reaching the airportNo sofas or any sort of place to just crash for a few minutes. I hated that.",During
536," If your'e in the market for an airport with simple and navigable design, Austin just made your list. Easy enough from curbside, dropping off a rental, approaching the security lines, etc. It's all there and hardly circuitous when compared to other airports. No need for crazy trains or major transportation within the airport either. Easily traversed on foot. Live music in shops and just around the airport in general. Keeping Austin very Austin-y. The Salt Lick BBQ has a spot on the main drag. Never a bad thing. Plus, the bathrooms were about as shipshape as a dive bar on a Friday night. Loved all of the colorful (and hilarious) graffiti and inscriptions on the walls of the men's room in the Delta terminal. Happy flying, friends!",During
537," Solid domestic airport that is t too big.  You can walk from one end of the airport to the other pretty easily.  The airport is clean and pretty efficient.  I have tsa pre but the other lines are not too badFood options are decent with local eateries prevalent in the terminal.  A nice change from chain fast food of other airports.There is live music in the bar/food area above baggage claim from time to time which has its Austin charm to it.The rental car center is newly renovated and just across the street from the airport.  Driving here can be a challenge if you are coming down from north Austin/Round Rock during rush hour, so make sure you use Waze to help you navigate.  I did encounter a few bats stuck inside the terminal, but hey, it's Austin.  No need to watch the bat show down by the bridges on the river.",During
538," Auntie at Austin:East coast family is visiting Austin family. We're blessed w/a second nephew :)This is a cozy friendly laid-back international airport. We're from an area that has 3 bustling international airports nearby so this is a refreshing treat. Upon entering, the checked baggage area was not busy at all during the summer weekend rush hour travel time compared to what we are accustomed to back at home. Genuinely attentive and accommodating airport staff. So friendly. Wow. Thank ye. Even though the security area was small, the line steadily moved. I can't even. Quite impressive. Once near the gates, there're good choices of eats to consider. We wanted something local before leaving Austin and Annies Cafe hit the spot. At gate 18. So glad we'll be frequenting this airport. We're missing baby NephewT already.",During
539," Terrible parking, beware of the Valet as they didn't give our daughter the family friendly ticket and overcharged us six days at $27 per day. They told me to leave a message for Mr. Barry and I did and they never called back. Talked to Marcel the manger and he told me to go ahead and complain he didn't care. Beware of overcharging practices.",During
540," We flew in and out of this airport during our week stay in Austin. We arrived in Austin via United Airlines at around 5:30 am. There were some coffee carts and eateries already open, but we were exhausted and headed quickly to baggage claim for our bags. Our luggage came quickly and they had some fun guitar artwork in the baggage claim area to check out while we waited. Parking was very close by, and we were at our awaiting loved ones cars in no time. We flew out of Austin once again super early in the morning. We arrived at 5:20 am. Dropping off near the check in area was easy, and we had plenty of time for some goodbyes. We made it quickly through security, and everyone was super friendly and helpful. This time we were starving and were very happy for the many open breakfast and coffee places. We got some egg and potato tacos and grabbed a seat as we waited for our flight. All in all it was a very pleasant airport experience for our family.",During
541," I'm giving two stars for the overall food scene there. Trying to keep it local or reducing the number of chain options is painful on the wallet and the options aren't that great. Shouldn't have to pay $15 for a marginal burger or sandwich. The rest of the airport is ok, has some issues w the security line quickness.",During
542," AUS is a nice size airport. Easy to navigate.  No too crowded. Nice art..... That's the good. And the BUT... worse food choices ever. I expected way better from a town like Austin. No restaurants. All fast food. Even in what appears to be sit down dining. #2. No shopping. When your 3 hour layover turns to 7 hour layover, nothing to do (except yelp about your terrible experience). #3. Hard to find a outlet that works which is necessary with a 7 hour layover. Blah! Hope to not travel through this airport very often.",During
543, Surprisingly small for an international airport in a capital city. Free wifi for 30 min. Most employees seem to be relatively content and in good spirits. It's mostly clean and simple to navigate.,During
544," Clean with a Texas flare, the smell of BBQ as you disembark the plane and then the funky music town vibe.  Bands playing just off 9th concourse with cold beer and drinks Avl.  I had 6 hours to kill till my flight left and was entertained.  The airport is super crowded, they should think about expanding to make it more comfortable as with the TSA lines grow longer and longer you need to get here earlier and stay longer.  over all the bathrooms were very clean and staff neat and friendly.",During
545," Simple, easy, and a great airport to fly in/out of. Everything is clean, and there are a good amount of food choices. 4 stars instead of 5 because if your flight gets delayed/canceled, it's hard to find another one because it isn't a hub.",During
551, This is a great airport and seems to be very navigation friendly! I also noticed how many eateries they have there however I was warned not to eat at some as they pale in comparison to the originals like Salt Lick for instance.Coming in was easy but leaving was not as easy however they remedied the situation as quickly as they could by opening up another TSA lane. I really appreciated that!Every staffer I came in contact with were pleasant and it really seemed like they were trying! I can't wait to fly in and out of this place again soon!,During
552, It is a favorite among the airports in the States. Not too big and not too small. A lot of good eats at reasonable price. Lots of decors relate to music.,During
553," I like the simplicity of the layout but they have very few accessible outlets.  The majority of the available outlets are on the far, rarely traveled ends of the airport.",During
554," Security is super fast but no great food options, everything is chain-like. However, they have free wifi!",During
555," This review is about the TSA precheck office in the airport. I had a 7pm flight so I came early to apply for tsa precheck. I got there at 4:10. They said they were full. I asked if they could squeeze me in. They looked doubtful. I left and decided to come back, telling them I'm going to stick around just in case..... I did and the lovely ladies literally squeezed me I. Before 5pm which is when they closed. This is a process hat I've been after for a full year. Had they not helped me, it would have been a no go and who knows when I had time to apply again. The process literally take 7 mins and $85. In 2-3 weeks I will be skipping the long security lines!!!!!!!!!!Oh and Schlotzskys is my favorite food spot",During
556," Are you serious?  We walk a mile to get to the terminal and no handicap parking? Piss poor excuse for airport parking! During our hike to get to the actual airport the so called full parking lots had multiple empty spaces. Get you crap together. Instead of spending a million dollars on ""art work"" get your parking situation straight!",During
557," I was very impressed with Austin's airport. The staff were very pleasant, there was a relaxed atmosphere, everything was clearly labeled, and you know the minute you get off the plane that you are in Texas. I've never seen so much state pride in an airport before. Very clean ladies restrooms, and the food choices were fantastic for such a small airport. I'll definitely enjoy flying in again when I visit my friend next time.",During
558," I had a flight this morning out of Austin to Los Angeles at 9:05am. I got to the airport by 8:00. Checked into the kiosk, printed out a checked bag tag, and waited in the ""main cabin"" customer service line.  After 40 mins of waiting, I was told that I was in the ""wrong line"" and told to wait in the ""bag tag"" line.   Time is now 8:40am. Explained that the flight departs at 9:05am. Was told there was nothing they can do and only the lady to her left can help.  Approached the ""bag tag"" counter and explained that the flight leaves in 25 mins. Told nothing they can do and to stand in the back of the line. After standing in the ""bag tag"" line for 10 mins, awkwardly approached the same lady who had turned me away and watched as she simply scanned my bag. After going through the TSA line (which was surprisingly short) and checking in at the counter, I was told that the seat was given away to stand by customer because I didn't get to the gate 10 mins prior to takeoff.  This exchange at the gate counter was on par with the customer service at the ""customer service"" line. CRISSY was a gem of an agent and proceeded with her eye rolling, sighs, ""I'll get to you when I get to you"" attitude in dealing with not just me, but with all other customers who were in line after their flight delays caused missed connections. Tried to speak to the manager - MARC at the American Airlines check-in counter and was told that's how it's always been. No ""sorry for your inconvenience"" or ""sorry for the mixup at the line"" or ""sorry for making you miss your flight because we can't figure out how to provide service to our customers in the customer service line.""  Nothing. I was placed on stand by for another flight to LAX at 5 hours later. STAND BY. Thanks to KATHY at the front counter who at least got me off stand by and with a confirmed seat. I've been flying AA for the past 20 years and today was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Today's lack of concern and care shown by the AA agents was pretty disappointing. Questioning whether to fly AA ever again.",During

560, I like that it is small but getting through security is inefficient.  If you are in a wheelchair you are to wait almost 20 minutes before getting through security. I felt so sorry for the tow elderly people being made to wait I. an uncomfortable airport wheelchair that increases discomfort.,During
566, As far as airports go Austin is a great one.  Easy to get around and modern.  I had some really good tacos waiting for a flight so good to grab some TexMex at an airport.,During
567," Airports give me anxiety. All the people, the waiting, the feeling of being herded like cattle... this airport is cool, and my anxiety slipped away easily. Everyone I came into contact with was extremely competent, professional, and personable, and efficient. Can I ask for more? Oh, yeah, some of the coolest shops I've ever seen in an airport - Austin City Limits  Waterloo Records, and then a more touristy shop where the clerk took care of 4 people in front of me in less than 2 minutes - and then gave me a 50% discount for the wait! There was a bar (no private membership needed) with live music, too! Also a fancy little Benefit make-up kiosk for you glamoramas ...",During
568, The guy at TSA apparently loves his job!! Made going through the line a lot more entertaining. I also had a shoulder injury and they gave me no issues with adapting my security check.,During

572," Austin's airport is fine. Smallish and modern airport which is great: from dropping your rental car off to the TSA line to your gate is generally pretty quick.They try to add some Austin-fare here. The food options are OK... tacos are plenty. Otherwise, it skews a bit generic. There's a Austin shop to buy t-shirts and things if you want your ""keep Austin weird"" shirt and pretend it's 30 years ago.It's fine.",During
573, Came back from a week long business trip to a car with a dead battery.  Yup. 90 degrees out and my car was dead.  No sooner did I hang up the phone at the shuttle stop than the service truck arrived.   I  wish I had gotten the gentleman's name so I could share it but he couldn't have been nicer or more willing to help me.

I know it's an airport, but the prices are ridiculous:(I travel through here a lot, and try never to get raped by these bastards!!!Heed my warning, you shall be pillagedI paid (with tip), $60 for two beers, and two shots for my wife and I, while waiting for a delayed flight.",During
575, Nice enough. Clean and even has all gender restrooms but they can't even keep the flight info screens up to date. Ran across the freakin airport to wait another 2 hours. Should have listened to FlightAware instead...,During
581," Thought this airport would be hectic, but it really is a nice, open spaced and easy going airport. Picking up my luggage very non-stressful and quick.",During
582," There is nothing quite like the Austin airport. After flying all around the country and visiting other airports, there is just something about the feel of ABIA that is different. Of course the feel is unlike no other due to the friendliness of the Texas folks. California airports are complete opposite. Austin airport definitely let's you know that you are in the music Capitol of the world. You can always score you some overpriced breakfast tacos and a Mexican martini or two while you're waiting. But... If you're just passing thru and have a layover and didn't have a chance to venture out in the city, don't judge our breakfast tacos by the airport... The possibilities are endless everywhere you go... I hear the BBQ is pretty good but wouldn't know since I'm a weird vegetarian.... Their is a lot of those here in Austin too... Welcome!",During
583," Flying into Austin is beautiful  green always! The airport is clean, well run, has that cool Austin vibe in the decor and live music the moment you step off the plane!   The restrooms are clean and there's a good selection of places to eat f you're in a pinch, although, I would stay away from Annies Cafe  Bar.",During
584, Some of the worst restaurants and bars of any airport I frequent. Really terrible food and drinks. I went the Salt Lick and sat for about 20 minutes not a single bartender ask me if I wanted anything. Your better off flying in and out of Houston or Dallas and driving if your hungry or thirsty. San Antonio is a better choice as well.,During
585," Forced to spend some time waiting on a flight, I can unequivocally state that this airport is a food desert.  It has probably the nastiest version of food court and associated vendors that I have encountered at an airport, Austin should be ashamed.  Only 2 options for tableside service exist and as one might imagine they are packed.  Options for dining prior to security are worse, a convienance store with tables.  Most convienance stores offer a better selection and a similar level of service.",During
586, As Airports go this is a good one.  I have never seen faster service plane to conveyor belt in baggage claim.    Phenomenal.  Good choice of restaurants and shops etc.  Parking is also pretty good.,During
587," It's pretty ridiculous that I have over 120 checkins here with no review.  Today's the day.  And a fitting day to review because there is not much to love about airport life at 4am.  But when u get through TSA and the first  thing u hear is Bob Schneider ""I just wanna feel good..."" playing over the airport speakers you know you're not at just any ol  regular airport.  This is a place that loves it's city.  Playing Austin institutions on the radio, live music at more than three locations in the airport, 90% of the food being from local joints, breakfast tacos, southwest taking up most of the gates.....what's not to love.",During
588, There were some premium chairs at Southwest gates with charging stations.  I was bummed that security check point # 1 was closed and had to walk all the way to check point #3.  In the future I would just walk straight there since the line is a lot shorter than 1  2.Parking as hard and we end up leaving the parking lot and I just got dropped off at the curb instead.,During
589," I'm disappointed with this airport.  It's obviously not a major international hub just yet and they are not running it like one either.  Showed up 1.5 hours early for a domestic flight at 5am, only for them to make me wait in security line 30min and then finally tell me to walk to the next checkpoint which was just as crowded.  Makes no sense and I barely made my flight.  Show up early!",During
590," This may be my favorite airport. It's small and so easy. The rental cars are close, there isn't much traffic in front of the terminals. Several shops and places to eat inside the terminals.",During
596," Great airport!  I appreciated that they told a bunch of us in line that another security checkpoint had a shorter line.  The live music really brings in the local flavor, and is especially appreciated when you're waiting for your flight (and/or if you're sad that vacation is ending and you need a prolonged Austin experience).  Everything was very clean, and I really enjoyed the local food vendors having a presence in the airport versus the typical fast food joints.  When visiting, be sure to check out the tacos at the Salt Lick BBQ Taco Stand and Amy's Ice Cream, of course.  This isn't a huge airport, and for that I'm thankful.",During
597," Security was reasonably quick and efficient (thank you, pre-check) and the airport is clean. Not a great layout and no moving sidewalks makes for a lot of walking (ok for me, but not for people that need assistance). My biggest complaint is they had very limited coffee and breakfast options available. While the breakfast tacos are a nice score and add to the authenticity, there were literally no other good options and coffee was pretty limited as well (no Starbucks in sight).",During
598," Love this airport! It is new, beautiful, and well taken care of. TSA here are friendly and the lines move pretty quickly for a medium sized airport (budget about 30-45 minutes on a weekday during non-peak flying times for security, and an hour or more to be safe on the weekends). We just flew on a Tuesday at 5:30am, and we went through security in 20 minutes flat (but we were there at 4am). The airport is small-ish so there's only one terminal which makes getting to your gate easy.Food options are really great here. Try local favorites Salt Lick BBQ and Amy's Ice Cream! Head to Waterloo Records store for last minute Austin souvenirs.",During
599," Don't hate on the small airport. They have completed some expansions which includes an extremely larger security area to the left of the terminals. I really enjoy our Airport. It may be getting small with all the events that Austin is recently pulling in, but I never really travel out during those times so I don't have any issues. I traveled the following Tuesday after SXSW this year, same day as the Brussels Bombing and had no issue. The ticket counter for American was short, just two people in front of the line emptying out their entire suitcase so that was fairly annoying, but the service people there were super nice and friendly. I've flown out on American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and didn't really encounter any issues from any of those ticketing counters. Security was short and sweet went through in under 20 minutes. The food choices are very Austin. I also go chainy and get a pretzel from Auntie Anne's and sometimes get some Ice Cream from Amy's. The BBQ from Salt Lick isn't the same as the real deal to me so I just don't go. I've gone to the Hoover's and was highly not impressed so I don't return. I've gotten Breakfast Tacos from the Maudie's plenty of times and they deliver on the breakfast taco crave. There's not a lot to do if you are in the terminal waiting area for a very long time. There are plenty of charging ports for your devices near the gates. I never have issue finding a free outlet, unlike most other airports I go to. There is sometimes a band playing near the Cafe Java area. There are some airport shops that sell your standard over priced airport goods. There is the best buy vending machine, where I've purchased some okay headphones last minute. The bathrooms are usually pretty clean as well.Baggage claim is great all one area, no hassles, there are plenty of restrooms over that area too if you made it through the terminal and past the no return point. There are few seats to wait for your bags though, that might be my only complaint, but after a flight the last thing I really want to do is sit more. Parking here is nice, there is plenty of parking for leaving your car, and shuttle service as well as plenty of other off airport parking locations that are practically on the airport. The pick up area is great, and there is a cellphone waiting lot as well, that is very close. The drop off area can get a little crazy when people have no idea what they are doing. Perhaps if the WiFi was a little better I might say it's the best airport....For the most part one of the best headache free airports!",During
600," I frequent this airport and it's always clean, never too busy and prices are average for the area.  Sometimes I will choose to fly out of San Antonio or Killeen but Austin is by far the best out of the two of them based off of the number of airports that you can get into on a regular basis with ease.As far as food goes- in the center next to Scholtzskys there is a  taco spot called Maudie's! Their Taco Salad is the Best Buy in the entire airport if you're hungry! A good amount of food and really tasty- request extra salsa-it's homemade!",During
601, Not to bad there Wifi is atrocious and the TSA lines are extremely long in the early morning took 90 min to get through at 5am on A Monday morning,During
602, I can't believe no one has written a review yet about the airport situation this morning (April 4th). It took almost two hours to get through security at 5:15am in the morning. How is this even possible? After I missed my plane (hundreds did too) I waited to speak w a TSA manager that never came around. After waiting for a manage that never showed I wrote tsa an email about the situation. Interested to see what the outcome will be. This airport is a joke to let a situation like this happen. Pre check got through with no issues while normal boarding waited like Animals.,During
603, Super easy and small-ish airport. Security was HARSH though. They took my 5 ounces of unopened BBQ sauce. Sigh. They barked ordered to the line the whole timeBut! once through security... Plenty of places that serve things covered in... your guessed it. BBQ sauce. A woman had a heart attach on my flight before we took off so we were delayed. Maybe they should have taken away HER BBQ sauce. Not enough plugs or seatingClose to the city Uber picks up there - although kinda in a secretish manner? It's the gateway to all that is amazing in Austin - like BBQ sauce!,During
604," I travel a lot. Ok, I probably travel too much for my family's sake. That said, I have a lot of experience with airports and the Austin-Bergstrom airport is my favorite EVER. I may be a bit jaded here as my experience is not like others'. I have so many miles that I fly SouthWest preferred and have a TSA-Pre.So, the parking is either SUPER easy or cheap. Your choice. This airport is getting a huge amount of business because San Antonio is so jacked up right now. I can park within 10 yards of the bridge to the counters if I'm willing to pay $23/day. For less than half of that I get to what the walk at San Antonio is. In fact, it's better than RVA or any other smaller airport.The baggage claim is super simple and very well posted. You know where to go according to your flight. So many older/larger airports never let you know what's up.My favorite is once you are at the gates. Almost all the shops and restaurants are local places with a presence here. Instead of the homogenized over-priced locations, you get local food an flavors. Well designed, well laid out, what's not to love?",During
605, This airport is different from other airports I have been to because it features local establishments unique to Austin. I always grab a plate of bbq from the mini salt lick booth because I'm reminded of a little taste of Texas before I fly out. This airport has 26 gates and 3 tsa check points. I have never waited longer than 30 minutes to get through tsa.,During
611," Really have this flow directly from gate to baggage and out the door. Efficient in every way, food has many selections and the Austin store ships items to clients a dream to fly into here!",During
612," Several of the charging ports weren't working. TSA was fast and got me through quickly. My friend, however, had to wait longer than expected because her military ID had expired.",During
613, Clean quick to get around airport. Good bites inside and clean big bathrooms in the the terminals in the high #'s. I like the most is the rental car location is within walking distance.,During
614," I fly in and out of AUS several times a year and every single time the TSA security check takes longer than the last visit.  I allow at least 90 minutes EXTRA just for the security check in.  To be clear, this is additional time over and above what the TSA recommends.Really, this is longer than any other airport I have ever been through.  Mexico, Central America, Caribbean  and Europe, these are the worst security lines of all the places I fly.The foods not bad once you get into the secure area so plan ahead and have your meal in the airport before you fly.",During
615," Shitty service, the lines are comedically long, and check in takes too damn long because they only have 3 lines for everyone. Never coming back here. This is why we need the hyperloop",During
616," Easy to get in, east to get out. What else can a guy ask for? Oh, I know. How about a big ol'l bag of Salt Lick BBQ before jumping on the plane? Yep, they have it! There's another spot that always serves up affordable, grab-and-go breakfast tacos with a good selection of hydration options. We all know that after a stint in Austin a tall bottle of water or a few giant gulps of classic red Gatorade will make your flight much, much easier.",During
617," Be aware that if you are more sensitive than normal regarding radiation, there is a rude TSA lady in her older years with her hair pulled back who doesn't tell the truth about the body scanners. She will tell you they do not emit radiation but they still do. It's lower than earlier versions though. If you mention to her that you prefer to have a pat down she will say rudely, ""You know what you're asking right??!? (Yes) Okay because you're asking for a full pat down by an agent who will check you from head to toe."" Yes, I know. She is very close to laughing at you and rolling her eyes. I can only guess she hates life and decided to join a job where she can freely be rude and not get reprimanded. I got to the pat down lady and she was happy and very sweet. The other agents around her were the same. I've had to encounter the rude woman on a previous flight out of Austin and she was exactly the same. She is either lying about her knowledge of the body scanners or she has no idea. The information is online. Knowing the information may be beneficial to anyone who's fought cancer.",During
618," Flown in and out at least a half dozen times, no complaints  by far still better than our LAX experiences (Californians) even though this time we flew in on the starting Saturday of SXSW 2016, crowded yes, really? But come on this was cake for me, baggage claim was quick and easy. I've been taken into rooms here to be searched and still no complaints, I hope this is always the case. I really like it here.",During
619, Short lines at the security but the wait to enter the terminal took much longer than expected. Not many variety of restaurant options and the seating locations all do not have enough occupancy. A little improvements and the airport would be much better,During
620, I always travel to Austin Texas doing the summertime I love the airport especially when I come into town for ssw The only thing I dislike about Austin is when I go to  pick up  car from Hertz they are the most horrible company I ever experience,During
622,],During
627," Great experience with AUS even though I felt like death on my way out. They allow Uber to pickup and dropoff making my entrance and exit super easy. People say this airport's tiny, but coming from CHS, it's a decent size and I was impressed with the non existent security line. Food options are plentiful and even tough I could barely get down one of my two taco due to my dirty sixth hangover, it still helped me get through the day.",During
628," Austin Airport is a great place to fly in and out of.  The airport is compact, there's a nice variety of food and drink options at a decent (for an airport) price.  The lines through security were short to non-existent.  I particularly liked the asian buffet where the food was 6.99 per pound and the Salt Lick.",During
629," Austin is a such a great town that people put up with flight options that may require a connection in another town.That aside, their food options in the airport are decent. There is the obligatory Mexican place along with a very good barbecue and a few other options. However, no Starbucks.Finally, building off their rich music scene in the city, I enjoyed hearing the music playing throughout the terminal. Not ""elevator"" music but ""good"" stuff, like the blues playing while I was there.",During
630," An easy-to-navigate airport with pretty much everything you need - and some things you don't, like TSA. Huge points earned for having Car Rental within walking distance of the terminals. It's nice not having to schedule an extra half hour for an unreliable shuttle ride (I'm looking at you, LAX). During a recent trip to San Antonio, I chose to fly into AUS and drive down. 100% would do this again in the future. Getting a direct flight to Texas was well worth the extra couple hours of driving, and you get to see lovely San Marcos along the way. ;-) Okay, it's just the highway, though aside from the dapper gents rolling coal, it's not that bad. I'm undoubtedly be back here soon for SXSW and am looking forward to it! This is definitely the place to fly into for your visit to the Lone Star state.",During
631," Oh man, I really like Austin.Twice I have driven into Austin and then left via AUS airport.Twice have I listened to live music while eating delicious tex mex in a friendly bar area.Twice have I easily walked from one side of security to the other: no line, no hassle, just security. Twice have my planes left a little late (and you know what, I was happy to have a little more time to kick it). Last time, we dropped the car off at Enterprise, took the elevator downstairs, and within five minutes had walked through a cool looking art installation and up to the United customer service. After a brief visit to the United Club (hot soup with your cocktails anyone?), and about an hour of originals and covers from an adorable female guitar player, I bought a David Sedaris book at the bookstore, a couple of deli salads to-go, and walked onto my plane. Easy-peasy.",During
632," Nice airport. It's small in size so very quick to get from game to baggage claim or from ticketing through security and to your gate. What really makes this airport stand out is the great selection of local food and drinks at the airport, such as Salt Lick and Amy's Ice Cream.  Always. Pleasure going through this airport.",During
633," PROS: Easy, clean, free wifi, Uber and Lyft will pick you up at baggage claim, and the place isn't very busy. Well, at least it's not in January.CONS: No Starbucks (WTF, AUS?), food is just alright.Very pleasant experience! You don't get much choice in airports -- it's not like you can boycott bad ones. I mean, if you gotta fly there, you gotta fly there. But AUS was supremely easy and nice to travel to/from.And I know this is kind of odd to remark about, but the floors are really smooth, so you don't get a lot of noise from people's suitcases rolling around. It's pretty quiet. Way to go, Austin!",During
634," I find this airport to be very easy to get in and out of as well as it being only about 10-15 minute drive ( without traffic) to the downtown Austin area.  It is a smaller International airport, which I like because lines are typically shorter. There is always a direct flight to and from Ft. Lauderdale on Jet Blue  which I absolutely love. Security lines are pretty efficient here as well compared to other airports I have been too. There is free wi-fi and you are greeted by the smell of BBQ upon entering haha. There are lots of food and drink options as well as shopping while you wait for a departing flight.",During
635," Growing up in the the DFW area there will probably never be an airport that compares to the enormous one there. I feel like the Austin airport is hit or miss. Austin has a big population for such a small airport. There are always tons of big events here and it's a capital city... You would think our airport would be bigger, but nope. The security entrances to the terminal at times will take 15 minutes and other times over an hour.  Once I almost missed a flight because of this. Now I am super paranoid and always get here really early so that never happens again. One thing I will say is that at least the food options are ok here so if you do get here early you can chill with a hot tea and write Yelp reviews .... Or whatever your thing might be.",During
636," Much, MUCH cheaper than flying in/out of San Antonio. AND more non-stop direct flights are offered. Total win.And that's not to mention that there's a Salt Lick in the terminal - a Salt Lick that serves breakfast tacos! Breakfast tacos, beer, brisket, and live music while you wait for your plane to board?? Also total win.",During
642, The AUS airport is pretty efficient. Better food choices then most. The TSA agents were actually friendly. Renting a car on site is so expensive I'm not sure why. If you have old school Garmin GPS-it is hard to find satellites in the immediate area until you are a ways from the airport.,During
643," One of the newer airports if I am not mistaken. (drove by the old one which is now filled with McMansion looking things where the theme song from the Showtime show weeds seems to play)Clean, efficient, friendly. I was here in 2006 and some of the food court choices seem to have been upgraded.A nice place to arrive/depart to which is more than I can say for MANY more airports in this  country.",During
644," Easy peasy.  Easy to get to, and easy to navigate.  With that said, this International airport is surprisingly expensive.  There are fewer direct flights than I'd expect to see.  I opine that Austin is a big enough area to warrant the airport being more relevant with regards to travel.",During
645," My favorite airport ever. Easy to navigate, lines always manageable, great selection of local food vendors (Amy's Ice Cream, Thundercloud Subs, Ruta Maya coffee, Hoover's soul food, even Salt Lick BBQ), equipped for live music, free wifi, plenty of seats + chargers, and it's got a new building for rental cars, just across the departures terminal. Walking distance, super convenient. Love ABIA.",During
646," The Austin airport is pretty small, which I think is great because I didn't see a lot of cars at the airport. I don't recall seeing moving walkways at the airport, so get ready for exercise! It was a long walk from our arrival gate to the exit. Likewise, it was a long walk from the ticket counter to our exit gate. Because the airport is small, the car rental area was a short walk across the street. Once we left the terminal, we were soon on the road.Moving through security was easy as well. There are multiple security checkpoints, so security didn't take too long. They also have TSA pre-check, which was super quick. There are a ton of food options at the airport, including ice cream! Amy's Ice Cream is located right in front of gate 10. There are small round tables near the gates, so my co-workers and I dropped off our bags near the seats and stood at the tables to discuss business. It was very convenient.There is also free wifi at the airport, but only for 90 minutes.",During
647," I love the airport but it's a bit small and maybe can't handle the traffic/growing population.  I have NEVER missed a flight in my life until last week.  I walked in 90 minutes early to see the Southwest baggage check line out the door!  As soon as I saw that I knew I was in trouble but there was nothing to do.  I had to check my large luggage. I don't know if this is a complaint on SW or ABIA but this was 5:30am.  I usually fly out early to avoid this kind of mess!  Needless to say I missed my morning flight and had to wait for an evening one so this was my first experience ""stuck"" in an airport.  ABIA is a great one but so small that after eating, listening to live music, and walking around looking at art I got bored quick.  I think the airport needs to be bigger to accommodate the traffic going through it.",During
648, Breakfast tacos while listening to live music? Check.Watch the '06 Rose Bowl at Earl Campbell's? \m/.Packaged Amy's Ice Cream to take on your flight? Check.Salt Lick BBQ brisket? Check.Free Wi-Fi? Check.Austin-Bergstrom is almost too nice. I wish it could teach other airports to be less bad.,During
649, Beautiful and clean airport. Why can't they all be like this?! AUS gives you the best traveling experience possible!,During
650," I count my lucky stars every time I fly out of ABIA. It is simply the best airport in the country.Whether flying domestic or international, checkin/bag check is simple, security is quick, and the personnel are professional and polite.The food options are pretty stellar, too.A few food highlights - Thundercloud Subs is the same as it outside the airport and not marked up a ton for airport prices. Get a chicken biscuit from Hoover's for breakfast. Get a BBQ taco from the Salt Lick in the Salt Lick Lounge. Get an English breakfast at Annie's (very close in quality to the one on Congress). And, finally, get a local craft brew at Saxon Pub before you board.Oh, and you can't find a Starbucks here, and that's awesome. Hit Austin Java for coffee - it's better, I promise.",During
651," I like this airport.It has that funky Austin feel, easy to get your luggage, and easy to check in for a flight. There is a lot of food choices when waiting for your flight and they definitely support UT Athletics (you'll see). It was a little confusing regarding dropping off my rental car, so I bumped it down to four stars. Overall, I had a great experience and I look forward to my next trip to Austin soon!",During
652," Moderately sized airport that's fairly easy to navigate and get in and out of, whether you're driving in and out of here or taking a shuttle. The overall facility is clean, modern, and reasonably spacious, and there are enough power ports everywhere to keep you glued to your devices while you're waiting for a flight. While it looks like there are plenty of good, local dining options here, they could be open at both earlier and later hours.Otherwise, not a bad place to fly in and out of, and sometimes you may be able to find very low fares into here if your destination is otherwise Dallas, Houston, or San Antonio and you don't mind a moderately long drive to either of those cities.",During
658, A bit bigger with a delay on boarding our flight. There seems to be more comfortable seats that get taken up really fast. Food options limited as you can expect.,During
659," Not a huge airport, but a nice airport. Decent amount of food options, areas with live music... relatively easy security lines. Not too shabby, Austin-Bergstrom. There was nothing absolutely spectacular that stood out to me about this airport, but nothing rubbed me the wrong way. And overall, the food and atmosphere were pleasant enough to say that I am a fan. Plus, I love your fair city of Austin, so you have that going for you. Stay weird, Austin!",During
660, Michael Fahey at Hertz is AWESOME! Five star service every time! I don't hesitate to rent from Hertz every time I'm in Austin! Thanks Michael!,During
661," One of the easiest airports to travel out of. Small, easy parking, and lots of great food choices.",During
662," Very good airport...has the Austin live music and bbq feel, it's pretty clean and easy to get to. Tends to be extremely crowded at times especially close to music festival and racing season so get here early and kick back with some Salt Lick tacos!",During
663, I love that as soon as you walk into the airport terminal there is an Austin vibe. There is usually live music playing and a great selection of Austin food establishments. When traveling home I always grab a Salt Lick brisket to go which includes one BBQ sauce. It's such a treat to be able to take the BBQ with you to heat up and share with family and friends. You can also grab Amy's ice cream which is delicious and they always have fun flavors to choose from. There is also a Maudie's stand which has really good Tex Mex. The souvenir store has a good variety of T-shirts and longhorn candies to grab. The one downfall of ABIA is that there a few flights that fly direct. You can usually get checked in and through security quickly. The baggage claim is also usually very time efficient.,During
664, Great airport! I had TSA Pre-check and was from curb to gate within 7 minutes.  Delicious food options too! A french-style sandwich shop near my gate was yummy and perfect for my flight home.  I also really appreciate the free Wi-Fi!,During
665," Keep Austin Weird  Welcome to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, so named after Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, the first Austinite to be killed in the second world war.  At just 5 miles southeast of Austin, ABIA is the 34th busiest airport in America.  Austin-Bergstrom has two runways, three helipads, and live music!  That later is what makes this city cool and keeps Austin weird.  Check out the ""Music in the Air"" link on the airport's website for performance listings.  Definitely worth your time. Have a great day and a safe flight!!",During
666," ""Cause I'm leaving.  On a jet plane.  Don't know when I'll be back again.""  Home town airport.  Love to travel.  But I'm always happy when I'm back home.  Xoxo Austin!",During
667, This airport is up there in the top as one of the best. Easy and on site car rental is a huge plus for me!,During
673," As far as airports go, on a scale of DFW to SFO, Austin Bergstrom is somewhere in the middle. I love the wine bar, but don't love that they won't sell me a beer in the AM before I get on an airplane. Also, the walk from security to your terminal is always a LONG walk.",During
674, This airport is ridiculous. Security took 45 min  TSA had all kinds of rude attitude. Everything inside the airport closes at 8pm. Bleh,During
675, An airport with a lot going for it. Small local feel but it's growing and hopefully it continues in the right direction. I'm a frequent flyer on American and this plays nicely and ABIA. I'd definitely love to see more direct flights and see it become a larger hub so I don't have to connect through DFW all the time. But I have a feeling that will come soon enough. Admirals club is solid too.,During
676, Traveling through the holidays I realized that there are now 3 security check points. This is fabulous! There is an estimated time at each one with the times of the other check points as well. Security on thanksgiving took me 10 minutes. There are always things that can be improved but the airport is definitely going in the right direction for more business.,During
677, Terrible airport. Long lines for security and very unprofessional and confusing. If traffic getting to airport isn't bad enough the traffic getting to the gate will make you pull your hair out...and you haven't even gotten on the plane yet. Fly out of San Antonio or Dallas.,During
678," I can't tell if the new updates are helping or not... but it sure looks nice. Also, I go here when I need to fly someplace. Ohhh, airplanes!",During
679," When I lived in DFW, I absolutely loved being able to fly direct to just about anywhere in the country (and many places in the world). Flying out of Austin means connecting somewhere, but there isn't a lot the airport can do about it. It's a great airport that is always quick to get in and out of. The new security checkpoint near the Delta/SWA check-in area is amazing/beautiful. For an airport on the small side of things, it's a fantastic place to depart/arrive.I'm not sure if Wifi is always free, but last time I was there, I could get free wifi for at least an hour or two which was super nice. Of all cities that you would expect free wifi, Austin should be at the top of the list, right?",During
680, The rental return area is badly marked as are the security lines for specific gates. It may be you can get to any gate from any security line but we didn't test that out.,During
681, No complaints here. Not the biggest airport compared to most big cities but never had a problem. Decent food and enough flights to where it's not an issues.,During
682," What sort of airport can't offer round the clock valet parking?? I turn up for my flight and the valet parking is FULL??  WTF?!? So too was the close-in parking lot. This is totally unacceptable for me - I am traveling as a single woman coming back very late at night, I do not intent to walk thru a car park by myself with a heavy bag and high heels by myself. I kicked up an absolutely massive fuss, and the valet folks finally made an exception but I had to pay double. Having a full valet lot completely defeats the point of having an onsite valet lot in the first place. This really sucks because this is the EXACT reason I stopped flying out of San Antonio because they closed their valet lot. Not many other airport options for me now..",During
688," I love how small this airport feels. It's really starting to go a variety of international locations due to the circuit of the Americas, but yet somehow it still has a feel akin to love field airport in Dallas, with good customer service. Relatively small walking distance from the door to your gate most of the time too, which is really nice when you're taking a red eye flight.",During
689," Not a Texas sized at-all.  It is amazing that it is international.  I'll admit, though, that some may like the quaint and quiet this airport offers.  The rental car offices are across the lot which is annoying.  The amenities are meager. The food selection limited.  Overall terminal and gate seating area size is usually woefully inadequate. At least they expanded one of the wings to screen passengers much more quickly! No more removing a bunch of crap, shoes, belts, and/or laptops from bags.  Their scanners cover everything.  You can still get called aside, but on the whole if you pack properly it won't happen.",During
690," I usually don't give airports five stars (because who the hell loves airports?), but I feel like the people who run this place deserve all the praise in the world. Let's back up a week. There were the floods in south Austin, and half of the city was flooded. I was unsure if I would be able to fly in after reading Tweets about people stranded at the airport and the control tower being down. But the weather cleared up, and with the primary control tower still down, ABIA had to rely on their secondary tower. All this, and I think our flight was just 10 minutes late. What could've been a stressful-as-hell situation instead became the start of a really fun vacation. Things were pretty smooth on the way out too. Security people were nice, and you don't have to take off your shoes, which is a plus. The entire airport is actually pretty clean and modern, with gift shops and restaurants everywhere. Not like one of those airports where you end up at the far gates and it's a dead zone.",During
691, I really enjoy leaving and coming out of this airport! It's small and the TSA employees are quick.  I guess it's a plus too if you travel during the week day but when on Sunday's in the afternoon the airport is not hat bad! Uber and lyft can pick you up from airport as well!,During
692," I live where I can choose to fly from either Austin or San Antonio.  In the past, I always used San Antonio.  Over the last couple of years, I have been changing to Austin.Why have I changed to Austin?  This airport is easy to get in and park.  Traffic, using 130, is not bad at all (love driving 85 MPH).  Parking is easy, but they could use better signage.  Terminal feels like it is very new/clean.  They have some good places to eat and drink, but they need more (fix this to be a 5 rating).  It seems that there are more flights and destinations than San Antonio.  Plus it always seems cheaper to fly out of Austin compared to San Antonio.You can bet that, for my next trip, I will be flying out of Austin!",During
693," Austin International Airport - wish I could have said you were great, especially w/ all the raving reviews but my experience was not great.Heading to Dallas - right in the worst storm of the season, we were diverted to Austin due to ground closure at DFW.  Our plane sat on the tarmac for almost 3 hours before we were ""forced"" to finally pull up to the terminal  off-board.  ( our flight crew had timed out )Entering the terminal around 10:30pm, it was like a ghost town.  The gate staff informs us that all facilities - restaurants  shops - were closed as of 7-8pm so there were zero resources for us....no food  nothing to drink, except for a water fountain right outside the restrooms..... and me, with no refillable water bottle!What terminal would see their restaurants closed as of 8pm??  There were certainly other flights departing at 10:30-and-later when we were there.....this is a lost revenue opportunity for you  a loss of sustenance-resources for us.  Lose-lose!I think at some point, someone discovered a vending machine but come on.  That's pathetic!Their wifi must have also been shut off at 8pm because there was no connection - no big deal for me since I have unlimited data but the point was that there was none to be foundOverall, not impressed w/ this terminal!",During
694," This Airport is awesome. It is one of the organized airports I've been to. Very clean people friendly believe it or not. I was impressed! What really impressed me was that they have an ESSIE machine!!! Whhaaatttt!!!!! I guess it makes sense, polish your nails while you are waiting to board. Awesome! I also did long term parking for 3 days and it was a total of $28.00. Not bad! I originally picked somewhere else but this was cheaper and I was already in the long term parking area for the airport. The have the shuttles to take you to your airline and they are for the most part friendly. I got a friendly guy going but returning, not so much. Don't forget to tip if you can, even if it's a dollar. Well I tipped going cause coming back, the service was meh. Other than that, AIS, you are an awesome airport!",During
695," Nice to come back to Austin, loads of nice shops, including cowboy boots and BBQ.keep Austin weird!",During
696," ABIA has always been my favorite airport.  It is small, fast, and efficient.  I love everything about how simple this place is.  Welcome to Austin.  Please don't move here.  Sincerely Austinites.",During
697, Zoomed right through TSA Pre Check. Delta ATL was Gate 6 right at there.Delta took my standby and I was out of there two hours early.Made the whole experience great.,During
703," I grew up in Austin. I remember a day when this airport didn't exist, rather flew out of Mueller. The airport does try to keep up with the fast pace growth of Austin but I still think they are behind...you need more baggage claims or spread them out (there were 5 flights on one baggage claim...all the others were empty?) oh, and if you are picking up someone from the airport...if you follow the signs on the ground, you will change lanes twice. Don't look at the sign in the air at the fork. The blue sign points directly at the fork and says passenger pickup!!! My wife and I both have missed our turn because this sign is inappropriately placed. You would think an airport could figure out clear communication.",During
704, I fly a couple of times a week though the Austin airport. Usually spend 40 minutes waiting for my bag at baggage claim. Don't understand why it is 2 to 3 times slower than any other airport I have been to.,During
705, Easy to deal with - nice food selections. Early am flight had long security lines. Luckily I had TSA Pre-check,During
706," Flew into Austin for the first time this week and I was so disappointed that everything in there was closed before 8pm! If I wanted to grab a coffee or snack on my way out, it would be out of the question! The rental car center is a hell of a walk from the terminal, so get ready for that. There also aren't any moving walkways around the airport and considering how long it is, would be helpful if there is ever any tight connection.",During
707," One of my favorite airports. Free Wifi. Great little shops. Very clean and no hassle checking in, security or waiting",During
708," While I like the design and cleanliness of the ABI airport, TSA needs to do a better job of regulating the line going through security. Too many people cutting in front of the line, and I'm not talking about the TSA pre-approved crowd.",During
709," This review is for the on-site parking.But...must mention that the airport and terminals were great. Nice selection of eateries, there are ample areas to recharge your devices built into your chair as you wait to board and the bathrooms were small but clean. My TSA guy was very nice! Baggage claim can get a bit crowded as there can be multiple flights picking up from the same baggage carousel. The airport is built like a circle so it can be easy to miss the on-site parking entrance when driving, but don't fret, it's a CIRCLE, so just go around again. 10 minute grace period if you find yourself in the wrong lot. Covered and outdoor parking available. The outdoor lot was quite full but eventually found a coveted spot near the garage. You have to walk through the garage to get to the terminals if you park outdoors, so try and park close to the garage. Easy walk. I must say, everything was going well until I had to pay for my 3 day parking. I approached the parking booth gate-arm and experienced some of the worst customer service ever! I understand if you're having a bad day and didn't necessarily have aspirations as a kid of having a career as a  parking booth attendant, but there's no need to be a jerk. I rolled down my window and greeted the guy with a nice ""good afternoon"" and he didn't even look at me. He sat there organizing receipts. Maybe he didn't hear me or saw the large vehicle approaching his booth? Then I said ""hello"" (in a NOT sarcastic voice) and still nothing. So I held out my ticket and he grabbed it. There was an awkward silence so I asked him how much I owe, then without saying a word or looking at me, he gestures with his shoulder to look at the gate-arm. The parking fee is displayed on a small light box, but it also alternates with the flashing time, so when I glanced at it, I only saw the time and didn't know what was going on until he finally looked at me and pointed rudely and i saw the time change to the fee for a few seconds, then flash back to the time. He was very rude! I gave him my card, then when he returned my card he didn't say thank you or have a great day...nothing. Didn't even look at me. I said, ""Thank you sir, have a wonderful day."" ...and still NOTHING?! What a huge jerk. Even after all that, he took his sweet time to lift the gatearm for me to exit. You have one job in life and you failed miserably. Airport is nice, parking convenient, but horribly poor customer service at the parking booth. I would rather watch magnified video of ingrown hairs being forcefully extruded from skin pores on YouTube than visit the booth of parking attendant ""Mr Troillo ID #146"" at Austin airport. Yeah, I kept the receipt, bro. I wish the best for you. Travel safely!",During
710," Pretty sweet airport, especially if you are here for a while. There's local food chains to keep you entertained (not the best Austin has to offer, but you know), and free 90 minute wifi. The airport isn't super massive so it'll allow you to get from one end to the other in a breeze AND it's clean!Love that they play country music. Growing up in Texas, I'm always a fan.",During
711," I love ABIA! After spending time at the Vegas airport, seriously, Austin's airport doesn't even compare!",During
712," Cute and newer airport that is small enough for you to basically walk around the entire airport regardless of where your gate is. It's only about a 15-20 minute drive from Downtown Austin, and the rental car return is right across the street from the entrance! Super convenient. They also have Salt Lick BBQ and Amy's Ice Cream available inside the airport, so you can try some of Austin's best before flying out. It was super easy to get through security, and it wasn't that crowded. They have free wifi available for 90 minutes, and then you can pay for additional time if needed.",During
0," Last night, as we enjoyed a couple drinks among our Texan friends, we lamented the early morning flight that awaited us. Having never navigated Austin-Bergstrom, we had no idea what to expect, how early we should arrive, and so on. Fear not, our friends encouraged us; AUS is a small airport, you can choose any of the three security checkpoints, for they all lead to the same row of gates. As of this morning, I can verify this information! Our flight to Phoenix was at 7:15 this morning, making boarding time 6:45. We arrived at the airport at 6:05, and as soon as we walked in, Checkpoint 2 was just ahead. Current wait time was 10 minutes. Not bad! ""Go to Checkpoint 1,"" the security officer advised, ""it's quicker."" How airport security could be quicker than 10 minutes -- we just had to find out. Not only did Checkpoint 1 take 5 minutes to get through; both Starbucks and our gate to Phoenix were just beyond it. It was a win-win-win. AUS has got me nostalgic. It reminds me of similarly small airports I've enjoyed, like John Wayne and Ontario, that are similarly a breeze to get through. However, AUS bests the aforementioned airports when it comes to food and shopping options. Should we return to Austin, I'd like to see more of what the airport has to offer. Consider us fans! 'Til next time.",After
1," I've been flying a lot over the last 6 months, so I've been to lots of sky lounges. This is definitely one of the best with good food and excellent dessert, coffee and drinks .This is a huge place with indoor and outdoor seating areas  - in the shade.Lots of tech, comfy chairs and friendly staff too.Smells great with a nice relaxing audio system.Well done Delta - this is how it should be done everywhere!",After
2," Really appreciate an airport that is close to the city center. A 20-minute ride for me is easy peasy and I don't know if I'm just an expert flyer (pat on the back to me), but I've yet to experience any kind of hiccup with TSA or delays. I usually zip right through without issue!The food options sprinkled throughout are a nice mix of local spots and standard airport fare. The wifi is always working and there's even a program to link your CCs to a system to get rewards for purchases made at the airport. Ride share/taxi area is a bit of a trek when returning home, but we could all use a little more steps in our lives, so not a huge deal!",After
3, First time in Austin and the airport was pretty nice. I didn't really eat or do any shopping but they had plenty of Texas options as well as fun stores to shop at. The Austin store had some cool stuff to look at. Bathrooms were clean. Security lines were fast. Overall not a bad airport.,After
4," 4 Stars for a good, mid-sized airport that may not have a ton of lounges (just Delta), but makes up for it with good food.I won't repeat what everyone else has already said, but wanted to comment on the airport food options. They include some really modern options for folks who are feeling the need for a good pressed juice and vegetarian taco. Unlike most airports, you don't have to go to a fancy airport restaurant by some famous chef to get a good bite. I used my handy Yelp app to find the perfect fit for both me and my vegetarian partner. I had eaten my weight in migas breakfast tacos whilst in Austin and was needing something other than the typical burger and fried food you find at airport quick serve spots. I'd highly recommend the juice bar to anyone in my predicament, and I'd also look into your taco options (there are a few). My fellow Yelpers did not lead me astray!Otherwise, the airport was clean and well laid-out, and a size that felt really manageable.",After
5," This is smaller international airport.  The bathrooms are clean and have plenty of stalls.  TSA is pretty fast, especially if you have pre-check.  The international customs is crazy busy and lines backup onto escalator.  This was not planned well and probably after thought.  Highly highly recommend, global entry if this airport is your customs stop.  Food options are good compared to few years back.",After
6," Austin has a pretty great airport. I got here a few hours early for a flight last week and was able to walk around and enjoy this airport to its full extent. This airport has such a diverse selection of foods and restaurants (minus the Chilis) and it offers such a local flare that some airports don't seem to focus on. This place has a lot of different food stands for local companies allowing you to get the feel of Austin while waiting for a flight. I was able to get a chicken sandwich and a small ice cream while waiting for my flight and I couldn't of been more satisfied with the results. I also didn't mind going through the TSA checkpoint and the people working it we're friendly and made the process as quick and easy as possible.The Austin airport is a wonderful place to wait for a flight and if you end up having a few hours to kill here, it won't be a problem!",After
7, Terrible access to taxis and ride sharing! Have to walk VERY far only to wait in a long line for an elevator to Level 2 and another long walk. Miserable system-- who came up with this?!?!,After
8, Eddie and Jason at the Delta baggage drop-off counters were absolute lifesavers. I stupidly left my laptop on my flight from DTW in seat 4A and they were very friendly and persistent in helping me. I'll never forget their kindness and appreciate them and Delta for making my oops painless. Thanks again!!!!,After
9," Austin International Airport was fairly easy to navigate around.  It is just a straight row of gates.  So if your gate is between 1-10 or 30ish, leave yourself some extra time to get to it because they are located at the end of the terminals.  Lots of food and stores to kill time at.  Great to see Salt Lick BBQ and Amy's Ice Cream and get my last bite of Austin before boarding my flight home.Car Rental, Uber/Lyft etc are all across the terminal.  They provide a shuttle to go upstairs, but it is walkable.  I would suggested requesting your Uber/Lyft after you get to the pick up spot (in case you get lost).  Airport staff was fairly helpful and security lines was fairly fast.  No big complaints as I arrived and departed with no issues.",After
15," Modern airport with lots of local food options. Rental cars just across the terminal (no shuttles needed!). Clean and updated. Security is fast. Note no priority pass lounges, at least not now, but flagship launches for major airlines: American, United, delta",After
16," AUS is about as good as an airport gets when they don't have a great selection of lounges (they do have a delta SkyClub but delta flights are rarely a good deal through here. Lots of great restaurants  and funky Austin shops have satellite locations here, so you can pretty easily blow through a 3 hour stretch without getting bored.",After
17," Awful - will take great lengths to avoid this airport in the future .  Overcrowded with few food options.  Bathroom line was out the door and 20+ people down the hall.  Turns out the cleaning attendant decided to close half of the restroom so she could clean in peace.  I had a short layover (thanks southwest) and had to grab something to eat , make a pot stop and ended up losing my seat to someone who simply grabbed the coat that was on my seat and handed it back to me as I re-boarded.",After
18, I would have to say that Austins airport is really on top of their game. TSA lines moved quickly and it very clean and well maintained.,After
19," Really nice modern airport! On the smaller side but so clean and efficient. Very quick to get through, and signage is large and clear so you won't get lost and you can easily find parking, shuttles, car rentals, etc. Airports in general leave a lot to be desired but this is probably as good as it gets (stateside that is).

22," I have now been here twice but only remember my more recent visit. I had a terrible time on the way out but a great way on the way in. On balance, 4 stars seems like an appropriate rating, because I think the main problem is a temporary one.As construction is currently occurring, the design and flow of the airport suffer. Nowhere is this clearer than the rideshare app pickup! On my way into Austin, I selected ""red"" and a number from the menu on Lyft, since those were my options. I tried to follow the signs for ""rideshare"" the best I could. On my way out of the (beautiful) airport, I walked through the parking garage, which had signs that rideshare pickup was through the garage. Where, though? It was not clear!I asked someone who worked there where the rideshare area was, after trying in vain to find it. He told me that I had to wait for a tram to take me across the parking garage. I thought that was so odd...why does someone need a tram to get there? What poor design! Even if temporary, this is a terrible idea, since rideshare apps often charge you for late arrivals, while this may not be one's fault given the process of waiting for a tram. As a result, I tried to hoof it across the parking garage, but only then did I realize that it would be near-impossible to exit it, given the lack of elevators (I had a heavy carry-on) or...exits. So back to the other side I went, and I hopped on the dinky tram. This is indeed temporary. What is more permanent is the easy layout of the space, not to mention the copious dining options that almost all reflect local brands. There is plenty of art that shows off Austin's unique nature. The airport is spacious and modern in nature. The Delta area at the very end is gorgeous and has amazing bathrooms! The rest of the airport is wonderful too. They just need to fix their rideshare snafus.",After
23," I liked this airport. It's pretty compact and was very easy and quick to get dropped off at. TSA was fast and they have CLEAR. The Delta lounge was very, very nice as well and quite large.",After
24, The airport has gone through some significant renovations (With still more to come). Some desirable food options have become available and parking garages have been added with plug-in charging available. Designated Ride share pickup areas have alleviated some of the congestion at the primary pickup area. Terminal still needs to be expanded and additional direct flights would be nice to have.,After
25," The airport itself is nice and there are many improvements being made in the terminal.However, the parking situation is sub-par. Long term parking is a mess of individual small lots that get rotated through as they fill up. The shuttles take a long time and if long term parking fills up they are forced to off-site or backup parking which can take a long time to get to/from the airport terminal itself.If the parking situation was improved then I would rate the airport 4 stars overall.",After

33," The Austin airport is a small one with pretty much just one terminal. It does make it easy to come and go with ease. It's just 15-20 minutes south from the main city too. The car rental depot is but a short walk away from the main terminal; no need to take a long shuttle bus. It certainly makes it very convenient when returning your car on your way out while trying to catch your flight.Like the town itself, the airport tries to maintain a weird vibe with some artwork and murals scatter about. Austin is known as the ""Live Music Capital of the World"" so they even have stages scattered throughout for live musicians to rock out on. Some iconic Austin eats you will find. I did hit up the Salt Lick BBQ on a layover some time ago, but it's super over-rated; save yourself the trouble. You'll also find Amy's Ice Cream, an Austin mainstay known for their Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream. Time to pay Austin a visit!",After

36," Kudos to the folks behind the scenes at this airport. We flew in on a day with a major thunderstorm. Our flight was delayed coming into Austin to wait out the inclement weather. When we got there though, everything was running very smoothly which was impressive. There were a ton of delayed flights and they were still able to get us into the gate and off the plane fast.One thing that is slightly inconvenient is where you get picked up for your ride share. You have to make your way to the second floor of the parking structure and take a snaking path to the area where the drivers are allowed to pull up. I will say that there was a very energetic usher that tried to make light of the long walk by waving a flag and cheering us on to the finish line which put a smile on my face. They use a color coded system to determine where your driver can stop so it doesn't get too congested. Spoiler: it gets super congested. The parking structure is one lane to get out so you get stuck behind everyone else going out.",After
37, Slowest international airport in the world. Avoid it if you can. It is terrible.  Baggage claim is the pits. Spend the decoration money on improving service,After
38," This is the best little, but busy airport I've ever been to. They have all the best bars and restaurants in the terminal and even live music. You have easy access no matter what gate your departing from. They have massages, books and Texas nick nacks. The parking is finally completed and has great covered parking, and a decent shuttle service.  The cell phone lot has recently gotten a new gas station, coffee shop, and restaurants.",After
39," Fantastic, but sprawling airport, much like the growing city it serves. The parking is kind of a slog -- be prepared to get wet if it's raining and to sweat like crazy if it's summer -- but once you're inside, it's an easy place to get around. Nice wide, long walkways, cool artwork to check out on your way to your gate, plenty of eateries to choose from, and tons of bathrooms, which helps prevent long ladies' room lines. (Never had to wait more than a minute at Austin-Bergstrom, which I appreciate.)The staff I've encountered have all been pleasant -- it's the first airport I've traveled through where the TSA folks were cracking jokes to amuse passengers.",After
40, This is another airport that's unmemorable but convenient. TSA lines are usually decent and there are some ok food options in the terminal. The rental car facility is a fairly quick walk and doesn't require taking a shuttle.,After
41, I'm not sure how this airport got almost 5 stars. The food selection in the United wing totally sucks. The wine pours are very light and when United f'd up your flight the meal vouchers don't include alcohol! Won't be back to Austin for a long time especially on United.,After
42," It's an airport. What can you really say???The best feature I feel is the location of the rental cars. A quick walk across a short walkway takes you right to the counter and up to your car.  From that perspective, it can't get any easier.Once all the road construction is done, getting to the rental car parking structure will hopefully be less chaotic. Last recommendation. I don't know really why but every time we fly out of Austin towards the west, it's alway a really bumpy and rough flight. Is it topography or not I don't know but it happens in the summer as well as winter time.",After

53," Love the new terminal expansion with additional retailers and the East Terrace!  However ABIA will never be a world class airport until it spends better time and effort in maintaining cleanliness throughout the terminal, especially the garage and post security seating areas.  The two stairwells leading up to East Terrace and the Delta Sky Club are filthy with mud, debris, dust, bunnies, etc.  The seating areas in the inside and below the East Terrace are filthy too, not to mention the new gate seating areas. This was the case in October, November, and now December too. I travel world-wide on a regular basis and ABIA is one of the dirtiest terminals I've encountered.  It's very embarrassing for my hometown airport.  I hope the Austin Airport Authority leadership holds the cleaning vendor accountable.  Change is long over due for a deep clean and maintain cleanliness throughout the day!!! Travelers pay enough it Airport fees and taxes and deserve better!",After
54, Why no USO? Wasn't this once an Air Force Base? Sad commentary for Texas. This is a large airport located near Fort Hood and Lackland AFB.,After
55," I really love Austin's airport (ABIA). It's pretty easy to navigate, and lines typically move quickly. The space itself is large and clean. There are many amenities available and restaurants/eateries inside. Parking is an interesting game, and they recently revamped the garages and Uber/Lyft situation. It's more streamlined, but you do have to walk further. Definitely one of the better mid-sized airports in the US.",After
56," I love our airport, because it is Austin proud. I feel like it was one of the first airports in the nation to almost exclusively showcase local businesses and restaurants. I can't even name them all, but Salt Lick, The Peached Tortilla, and Amy's Ice cream are the don't miss list for sure. Even during the holidays, arriving at this airport an hour before take off is sufficient, which is great! Parking is a little bit of a mess because of construction, but it's almost finished. That's the only thing that might take a little bit of time. We like the ""close in"" parking, which is a tiny bit further than the garage but much cheaper. If you're departing out of the North Terminal, it's not the same address as the main airport. It's about 10 minutes away from the main airport, so rerouting can be stressful if you make the mistake of going into the main airport looking for a tram. There's no way of getting over there other than driving! Enjoy some Austin eats and short security lines!",After
57," I can only speak to arrivals, because my flight home left out of the South Terminal (and thank goodness I figured that out before it was too late!) For arrivals, this airport was fine. We didn't linger - stopping only long enough to visit the little girls' room - before making our way to the ride share pick-up area.That's one thing that could be a bit clearer, really. We spent several minutes walking in and out of the terminal before finally approaching one of the information counters to ask for help navigating the ride share maze.Turns out they have a specific location set aside for all ride-share riders, which makes sense these days. It's just not all that easy to figure out on your own, and it does require a bit of a hike to get to. (As of the time of this review, at least. They were in the middle of construction In October 2019, so not sure if that impacted a more direct route from the terminal to the pick-up area).Once we got that figured out, though, we were golden. Calling and meeting an Uber or Lyft driver is easy once you get to the right spot. Just find your zone's color and head on over.",After
58," Austin has been one of my favorite U.S. Airports to fly over the years. After around a half dozen flights into Austin I cannot think of one negative experience. The facility has a newer upgraded feel. Most of my experiences have been flying American which is a hub. Smooth check ins, timely security lines and speedy baggage claim are a few of the most friendly items flying into Austin. However most memorable is the art that is in baggage claim, particularly American Airlines guitars. I have no travel plans for Austin in 2020 unfortunately. Few airports I frequently travel are so well rounded with great shopping, restaurants and more importantly allows travelers smooth travel. 4.5.",After
64," I don't get to fly into Austin often, but I honestly wish I did. The airport is convenient, easy to get in and out of, equipped with ample charging stations and offer several delicious food and bar options. Their uber pickup is efficient and their facilities are modern, recently renovated and lots of cool art to funky up the space.",After
65," The lack of employees was startling. So when I went to the information desk to be met by someone so incredibly rude I was beside myself. There are still signs saying to get your ride share downstairs. Take the elevator down etc. So when I asked the woman behind the desk where to go because there is no downstairs...she rudely barked 20 instructions at me and when I said "" so no downstairs anywhere"" and smiled... she barked"" DID YOU LISTEN TO MY INSTRUCTIONS???!!!!!"" I nodded and said that I had but that there were so many instructions that I was left confused. she barked them again while looking out from under her glasses. I thanked her and simply asked if there would be further signage o the way because it was confusing... she literally snapped and me and all but called me dumb. I Looked at her and said you really should be nicer while at work. she grinned and said "" You have a nice day"" so evil and condescending ...HORRIBLE!!!!!! so I went outside got to the parking garage where 4 other people were looking for signs confused...no signs, no help...we wandered and walked so far...finally getting to the biggest cluster situation. Oh and the baggage claim had changed where they were dropping bags but no announcements were made so our whole flight waited over 30 minutes before getting directed to the new place....not a good beginning to entering a city",After
66, Love this airport and it's so easy to get around inside. The food is amazing as well and the security and TSA are super legit and make things feel safe!,After
67," Clean airport, affordable food and drinks. This airport has the best food options because it's Austin! I love peached tortilla",After
68, Small airport but it is trying to expand. Austin has gotten so busy that there are so many people and not enough restaurants and places to sit to catch up with the volume. You can get wine or beer to go at the salt lick line and walk around the airport drinking.,After
69, The airport is small so it's easy to get in and out of fairly quickly. The car rentals are across the street so that just a short walk. TSA line was non-existent so I was really early for my flight.,After
70," Very nice airport.  Always on time.  Their airline displays do no work all the time, but the nice thing about it being small all the terminals connect in the building.  It can be confusing where to be picked up.  The moved it from downstairs to across the bridge.  The rental car lane is a quick turn so be careful.  On Thanksgiving all the restaurants were closed.   If you come out of the airport and go straight under the highway, you can find a private farm of beautiful longhorns.  One of my favorite airports.  Bon voyage!!",After
71, Amazing and effective. Clean and many options to eat. One of the best airports in the nation.,After
72," Ample parking with shuttles, and they even give you a card to remember your parking space. When you are thriving they automatically assume you want outdoor parking and direct you that way, but we keep looking for a way to get to the covered parking garage but nobody can seem to direct us that way. It isn't easy to navigate airport with just enough to keep you occupied if you're going to be there waiting for just a short time.  Everything seem to run smoothly before and after flight",After
73," It's expanding! And clean! The people are actually nice. Must I say anything more ? (Pro tip: check out the restrooms, you wont regret it)",After
79, I frequent ABIA often .Lots of great food options and easy layout. Too bad the restrooms are always disgusting.,After
80," This is a modern hype airport. Its not huge it is not small. The airport has a nice parking garage but don't let its size fool you, always ensure to come with plenty of time for your flight. During the Holiday season it gets packed and you may find yourself missing your flight. The airport hosts a number of awesome restaurant names well known in the area making it hard to decide what you want to try. They also have breastfeeding Privacy PODS.",After
81," One of my favorite airports! The airport is big and has multiple security check-ins, one giving the approximate waiting time. The terminal area is trendy and has both BBQ cuisine as well as healthy options. The airport has a lot of souvenir shops and sometimes has live music! Always a fun experience at this airport.",After
82," Fairly modern, interesting art installations, but often dirty and showing signs of wear and tearI'm a frequent traveler and fly out of Bergstrom often. Here's a short list of pros and cons about Bergstrom from my experience. Pros- (1) fairly modern, (2) lots of interesting and some good restaurant options, (3) quirky art installations, (4) plenty of bathrooms and phone charging stations, (5) some international flightsCons- (1) The floors and seats are normally dirty, (2) absolutely asinine and crowded international arrival and Customs area (only travel internationally arriving into Austin if you have Global Entry), (3) overall facilities are showing some wear and tear and it's time for a refurb Other observations: TSA: The TSA checkpoint personnel are not very experienced and some are extra grumpy. Some forms of acceptable Federal identification stump them; so if you have a ""rare"" type of ID, be prepared to show a more common form to pacify the TSA drones in Austin. Parking: close-in short-term parking is generally available. I hate the long-term surface lots operated by the airport (slow and infrequent busses to terminal; zero customer service...). But there are plenty of quality independent offsite lots nearby.  Rental cars: The rental car facilities are pretty good. They are in a multi-story garage not far from the terminal.",After

84," Great little airport. When coming back with international customs the airport needs to step up its efficiency system. It took about 45 minutes at a minimum for 1 plane to start the preliminarily paperwork, then get bags, then visit customs. Suggestions- More electronic stands for the prelim questions.",After
85," Really enjoyed this airport, it has a distinctly Austin vibe to it all around! Great shops that are funky and cute and great to browse in even if you're not buying anything, and lots of fantastic dining establishments. Easy to get around and not as stressful as other airports (although the security line setup is a bit wonky).",After
86," I just had the rudest experience at the @southwestair check in terminals. I asked the attendant for help with scanning my ID and she told me that assisted check in was ""over there"". I tell the guy who checked me in, who was super nice and he says"" she's like that. I waved goodbye to her to have her stare back in confusion. My first time flying anywhere since my transplant started out shitty so thank her for me.",After
87, Late flyers beware! The airport only contracts to 9-9:30pm for every vendor. There is no option for food anywhere.,After
88," This review is specifically for the South Terminal. As somebody who travels extensively for work I can say that the operations here are terrible. First of all, it took a solid 20 minutes for our bags to arrive to the carousel from the plane. The plane was no more than a 2 minute walk away from the baggage claim area. Then picking up the rental car becomes a hassle because a shuttle to the main terminal is needed. Unfortunately, each shuttle can only take about 15-20 people MAX and the main terminal is another 20 minutes away. Do yourself a favor, if you are getting a rental car and flying from the south terminal add at least another hour to your arrival time.",After
89," What an amazing, smaller airport. Just a fun place to hang around as you dread heading home after vacation. Easy to navigate. Short TSA lines. Friendly staff. Funky art exhibits. What's not to love.",After
95, Great clean modern airport. Didn't see any of the usual fast food places you see in an airport. Everything was a good speed from checking bags to getting through security.,After
96, Seriously 830 pm on a Sat night whole airport rolls up the carpet not one place open to grab a bite or beverage. What a joke,After
97," I'm a fan of small airports, and Austin Bergstrom Airport is just that, but boasts of all things Austin!  I flew in here when visiting Austin for the first time and an airport makes a huge first impression of a city you've never visited before.  Well, the moment I stepped outside the gate upon arrival, I heard live music performing!  Yep, I'm in Austin, ya'll. I flew Alaska Airlines, so was around the B gates.  There was a lot to love about this airport, primarily because many of the businesses at the airport were local!  I love that.  Our gate was right next to Salt Lick BBQ, which was the number one place to get your last Texan meal before departure.  But there were other popular businesses, like Amy's Ice Cream, BookPeople, Tacodeli, etc... The airport is very easy to navigate around, since it's on the smaller side.  TSA lines went by very quickly and staff were very friendly.  I also liked that they had refill stations for water bottles.  Located south of the downtown area, this airport is within city limits, but would give extra time to get here with traffic on I-35.  Austin, I heart you!",After
98," Nice people but crazy service. Clear is the new priority travel service, where you can pay $15 a month for priority passage through security. Great service if you are willing to pay. If not gate agents treat you like a random chum. Feel free to pay $68 for an exit row... not super impressed. Some very nice service people.",After
99," A nice airport on a nice day!  On a wet, rainy, and cold day it's a disaster.  The ""new"" south terminal (portable building) makes you run ‍ from the airliner onto the puddled runway and into the terminal.  Then you have to make a dash for a shuttle bus that drives like 20 minutes to the main terminal, and literally drops  your luggage  outside in the water and tells everyone ""your luggage is outside in the water.""Fly into San Antonio and drive to Austin if it's inclement weather.   Imagine if MSY shuttled you to lakefront airport to catch a flight.  That's about the gist of it.  It's a few blocks to the rental cars.  This one guy said ""man, I thought when I got under here I'd be protected from the elements.But going past the suspended rock sculpture leaves you like a wet rat .  Very poor civil engineering.",After
100," If you want to rent a car or need other transportation such as a taxi, be ready for a LONG walk!!! If you have a physical impairment- good luck with your hike to the 'back forty.' It's mostly covered,but not totally. Be prepared to be a super human by pushing a couple of suitcases while holding an umbrella in pouring rain. Welcome to Austin y'all!!!",After
101," This is one of the easiest airports to fly in to or out of. The departure drop off area is pretty easy to navigate as well as the arrival area. The Rental Car pickup area is immediately across from the main terminal. I have never parked there, but I know they have a large parking garage and off-site parking. There is also Bark and Park. You can Park your car and board your dog. There is Great Austin food in the terminal, including Taco Deli, Huts and of course Amy's Ice Cream. They have a brand new section of the terminal open with International arrivals and a ""Toy Joy"" store.  TSA has been a breeze to get through even if you don't have pre",After
102, Ok for a small airport. Nowhere near as nice as Love Field.   Not much seating spots.  But some decent eating options at normal high airport prices.  I got a watered down margarita at a forgettable bar.,After
103," Without question, the dumbest set up for rideshare program ever. Everybody K'NEX through their mobile phones yet the mobile phones don't work in the parking structure where they have the rideshare program pick up. Poorly thought out, the people that think they're providing a good service for the users of the airport should be fired.",After
104," I love coming to this airport. People are so friendly and its less busy than the Atlanta airport. They have 3 checkpoints and you can check here for wait times aus.tsa.iinside.com I've always just breezed through here and never had any hassle. But I think this is sorta the appeal of Austin which is its a big -small city. People say ""excuse me"" when they bump into you and random people will just start talking to you while you're waiting in line to pay for your yogurt. No complaints!",After
110, Worst airport. Who makes you go to a separate terminal just to catch a taxi! Obviously Mayor and city planners are idiots! Haven't they ever traveled outside of Austin,After
111, One of the nicest airports to go through. Everything is easy to find and get too. Tons of options for food. Rental car is a little bit of a walk but easy to get too. Very wide open and they continue to work on it to modernize it.,After
112," Lots of funky art at this airport, and good food, but not much else. I had like 3.5 hours to kill so I wandered around trying to find charging areas for my phone (of which there are plenty, which was nice). They have a Delta Sky Club now too, at the end of the terminal (terminal 2, I believe?) but it's still $29 for their Delta AmEx Gold members (a ""perk"" which will be going away at the end of Dec. 2019, also).Ended up having a quick dinner at the Peached Tortilla, too, which was very good, and there were a lot of other eateries around it too. They have some different types of seats too but those don't have chargers near them. The ""regular"" seats had chargers spaced every 2-3 seats, and you can also find little desk areas to sit and work / charge your phones. TSA was fast too, although I have Precheck. Overall would go through this airport again, there is also free wifi.",After
113," This was a clean airport and it was pretty simple. There are no trams or trains to get from one section to another which some other airports have which complicates timing when trying to get to the right gate. You can take the Bus 20 to and from downtown Austin which is what I used and costs $1.25 each way.There's no quick way to get from TSA security to a gate if the gate is further away because everything is in one long hallway. For example, my flight was at Gate 34 and that's at the very end of the airport but there's no wait to get there quickly like a walking escalator thing (what are those things called anyway?).My experience through TSA was pretty smooth but it was also because I came here in the early afternoon on a Saturday so there was no one there. You can also get Clear if you want to do that.",After
114," Very nice airport. There are lots of amenities, restaurants, shops, and restrooms. The entire place is very organized and easy to navigate. It's maintained very clean, and I had no issues.",After
115, Pretty great as far as airports go! Instead of chains littering the concourse its local restaurants. Usually live music playing.,After
116, This is one of my favorite airports. Security can be long at times but if you have TSA pre check it makes it a breeze. The morning coffee selection is great as well once you are at the gates.,After
117," The seperate frontier and alligent airline terminal was kind of a disaster. They tried really hard with the food truck and it was very clean, but there was no wear near enough seating or space. Just way too small for such major airlines.",After
118," Clean and nice. Good variety or restaurants and shops, lots of coffee. Jo's honor based coffee bar was very cute.",After
119," Two stars simply because parking is close to the terminal (for those who need to use it), and the terminal is very clean, modern and navigable.  Otherwise, here's all I have to say: For context, I've flown in and out of probably 20 airports domestically and internationally over just the last 24 months. Never have I been to an airport where, on numerous occasions, the majority of personnel so badly needed an attitude adjustment than the Austin airport--security, shuttle drivers, baristas, ticket agents, etc.  In my years of travel, this is the only airport where I've told a TSA or other airport security employee, to their face, to ""get a new damn job!"" Of course, given that Austin is quite a yuppified, ""precious"" city these days, maybe it's fitting that their airport's personnel are full of snarky pricks who seem to hate doing their jobs.  I guess I see why Austin old timers tell me their city was much better pre-circa 2000.  Honestly, even LAX and O'Hare have had significantly kinder, more personable personnel as of late than AUS.  This, considering overseas ports of entry put LAX and O'Hare to shame in terms of service and just about everything.  Lastly, if this is Southern hospitality, then I'm sure glad I don't live in Texas.  Never have I been this negative about an airport, as I love the experiences of travel, but I pretty much dread coming to AUS.  And, Austin.",After
125, Decent airport. Wish there were walking escalators and more restaurants with table side service. No TSA Pre at one of the security checkpoints was also a bummer.But then I am spoiled by Portland's awesome airport.,After
126, One of the most convenient and quick airports I have used. I fly out of here very often and it is definitely convenient. They have may local eateries in the airport so don't expect to find subway or Starbucks here. There is a lot of renovation going on right now and they are expanding this growing city's airport.,After
127," Austin, Texas is a funky city. Meaning that it is one of the most eclectic and unique places that offers a diverse culture that focuses on some of the best live music in America. And before even patrolling the tourist spots of Congress Ave. and 6th St., many people must arrive at ""Austin-Bergstrom International Airport"" before anything else. I've frequented Austin on several occasions and find the people, culture, food, and atmosphere to be one of the friendliest cities in the United States. Their airport is very small but fairly easy to navigate and get around. When leaving the airport itself, its very easy to get out. Best of all, its only about a 10-minute drive from all the live music hot spots.The artwork and murals itself is a nice touch to represent the residents and people of Austin. There are two terminals here, the South Terminal and the Barbara Jordan Terminal. Both have fairly easy access to baggage claim and rental cars. I've also noticed the TSA provides a much friendlier hospitality than other airports I've flown out of.Since I was laying over for only an hour (from Houston, TX to Sacramento, CA), I really didn't have the time to venture too far off the beaten path. But they do offer all-gender bathrooms, charging stations for your phone/tablet/laptop, and fast Wi-Fi speeds. You will find a nice variety of unique restaurants to choose from but expect to pay very high prices anywhere you go. Overall, ""Austin-Bergstrom International Airport"" is a decent and above average experience. My rating, four stars.",After
128, This is a great airport. Easy in and easy out. Fantastic selection of food. The only negative for me is that there's always a broken elevator.,After
129," Nice little airport! I flew in on Frontier and they now land/take off from what they call the ""South Terminal"" which is basically one big room with three departure gates. *Please note: I am reviewing this mainly based on this terminal!This terminal only services Frontier and Allegiant (it's for the cheap folks!). I think they did a really good job of trying to make this space welcoming and comfortable. Pros: The rental car return was so fantastic, even after hours. There were people on staff to help me at 5am. The shuttle buses are clean and the driver are so friendly. The South Terminal has its own security which expedites the process. I waited less than 5 minutes to get through. They also have a little convenience store and it sells booze! Yes, you can still get your pre-flight cocktail in this oversized living room. Not to mention, if you buy a $4 hot coffee, it is self serve and you have unlimited refills. If you're not into grab-n-go refrigerated food, head outside to the beautiful patio next to where the planes sit. They have a taco truck that also serves food before sunrise. As well as cocktails for lunch and dinner guests. The seating area outside is lovely but please take note: there is no smoking out here. Bathrooms are wonderfully clean and located in the corner of the room. Another amazing feature: there are TONS of outlets to charge your electronics and free wi-fi that works really well. Cons: The shuttle ride takes extra time to get to the South Terminal. Yeah, it takes 17 minutes (according to our driver) to get from the main terminal to the south terminal. I had a rental car and had to plan my time accordingly since all rentals need to be returned at the main terminal. I will say that the buses run regularly and were even there when I arrived at 5:30am. If you don't like tacos or Mexican food and want a hot dinner, eat before your airport arrival if flying Frontier or Allegiant. Last note on the South Terminal: you have walk on the tarmac and up a ramp to get on your plane. I personally enjoy this experience because it's not mainstream nowadays. But if you have strollers, a wheelchair or god forbid crutches, it probably won't be as fun. Overall, I had a really great experience in this little airport despite the extra steps needed to arrive and depart. They did a great job making the most of the new South Terminal project and I would definitely return!",After
130," Hey AUS! This was the first time we met. I mean, you're pretty nice and have some solid food and beverage options in the Southwest Terminal. I will say, I found your TSA staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. I also thought it was pretty rad that you guys have recycling and composting throughout.As far as things to potentially improve upon, the bathrooms could be updated and cleaned a little better for my liking. I also would love love love more gender neutral bathrooms. There are definitely ample seating areas, but not enough outlets in those areas. All in all, you're pretty cool! It was brief, but it was nice to stop in!",After
131," Favorite airport ever! Live music all the time and it's always so awesome. Love just walking by and dropping a twenty in their hats or whatever- aspiring artists make people smile.  Stop a take a look you will see! First time seeing ""All Gender Bathrooms"" - way to go Austin! Maybe it's everywhere and I just haven't seen them yet but awesome job - all inclusive, and it's great to see. Phenomenal food options everywhere you look! Happy people - happy place!",After
132," This airport as I had stated in the photos and in the check in prior - a top 10 airport in the United States. Happy to have visited this airport many times and more to come as I stay in Austin and travel thru AUS for music.it's a pleasure walking through, talking through and What makes me smile the most is the Friday that the airport took in supporting local businesses throughout the entire terminals walkways and you see it you can feel it in the airport exactly what you feel outside for instance on rainy Street or downtown or even outside of the downtown area I love local support and LAX façade of local support, But it's really just buying your position in the LAX Airport and on that note the entire airport and call LAX and talk about needs an entire Restoration it's needed that for 20, 30 years, it's true I'm from Los Angeles, I take a lot of pride in what I have contributed into Los Angeles and Sherice locally locally and when I see our LA city Council not doing their job this seems to be the case for many decades now I look at other cities , hence Austin Bergstrom airport is a top 10 if not a top-five airport in the United States awesome experience great hospitality thumbs up to the staff that I need every time I walk through I'll see you this weekend.",After
133, I loved all of the artwork displayed around this airport. The main terminal is large with about 34 gates. Around six of them are for international flights. They offer a free cell phone lot and have tons of parking options to choose from. This airport has CLEAR and several of the airline clubs. I loved the art work displayed throughout and read that exhibits change on a regular basis. Frontier and Allegiant Air fly in and out of the south terminal. The offsite parking facilities will not extend to this terminal. If you are flying out of the south terminal you will have to park at the south side terminal parking lot. They offer over 1000 parking spaces within walking distance. It is $10 a day for the economy lot.,After
134," Fast, friendly, and efficient! Getting through TSA on a Sunday evening went super quick, and gates are easily and clearly marked. The noise level in the airport was quite quiet compared to most I've flown through.",After
140," You're in store for a pleasant surprise following upgrades that the airport and restaurants have been putting into place the past year. Peached Tortilla, Taco Deli, Flyrite, East Side Pies....to name just a few.  Go early enough to get something before departure.  What a treat!!!",After
141, For the United terminal they have updated it and made it a little bigger. Salt Lick has their own restaurant now. It is nice and calm on the weekends but crazy during the week.,After
142," I never thought I'd actually be raving about an airport but this place is pretty awesome! First off, the security here makes life so much easier. I don't know if it's the southern attitude, but I find that I always make it in and out ASAP here. Lots of dining options are to be had while here which is the best part of this whole place. Of course, my preference is hitting up Juiceland for a pre-flight smoothie. My only gripe is the bathrooms! They seriously need to ditch the automatic flush because from what I saw, nearly 95% of toilets were not flushed making for a truly gross experience. Other than that, it's become one of my favorite airports thus far!",After
143," I love this airport but I could be biased because I know it so well. The attendants are very nice. The only complaint is once you are through TSA there could be more signs to let you know where to go. But the food options are great and a lot better than other airports. There is definitely room for improvement as far as space goes. But I assume they know that already. Anyways, great airport. Will return ;)",After
144," I love this airport, it's clean and everyone is really nice. On my way back they were passing out cake to anyone who wanted it. They were celebrating a direct flight to I believe a place in Germany.  The line getting through security was a breeze. There may have been one worker that just gave me a weird vibe, but besides that everyone was really nice. It's probably my favorite airport",After
145," Such a beautiful airport! Has everything and anything you could ever desire. Very clean and organized to flow throughout.I love that there's a benefit vending machine, actually just love that there's a vending machine for anything.",After
146, My local airport. I love it and it is always getting a facelift somewhere inside.They have a few Briggo coffee bots also scattered around - check them out and have a great custom cup of joe waiting as you pass through security or walk off the plane! No lines! :)The staffing here is nice and the airport is always quite clean.I only wish the rideshare wasn't so far away from the terminal. Austin is a tech city - seems odd we have to treat them like lepers.Expansion is always happening and in the next 5 yrs Im sure the landscape will look nothing like the last 5 yrs.,After
147, The directions painted on the street are not clear if you need to park and go to the TSA pre check offices. The caveat is that people there are. Sry nice and helpful to get you where you need to be.,After
148, Ride share pickup area is an overly complicated mess. The airport itself is ok but leaving the airport when you arrive is annoying.,After
149," You know, it's easy to bag on an airport and complain about anything because traveling can be difficult- but honestly, this is a smaller international airport and I feel like they've mastered it well.  They are undergoing construction in various parts and it is being done in sections.  I go to this airport numerous times a year and always have great customer service from most airlines, the security moves and is efficient, the food options are large and the gates are easy to get to.  I really can't complain.  I just hope they continue the ease of this airport as it grows with the traffic and city.",After
155," It's a small airport that allows for an easy travel experience. There are several eateries  scattered throughout the terminals. Finding a location to grab a quick bite is easy. The airport is well managed, far more than the city itself.I'm not quite sure how many non-stop international flights can be booked but it's a clean and stress free airport to fly out and into.",After
156," A nice effort at creating a flow and layout that reflect the city of Austin, including at least two live music stages.",After
157, This was such a cool airport. I especially love that the bathrooms were floor to ceiling doors that is what we need all over America I don't need anyone to see my feet while I Pee or poop. And that there is definitely some hip artwork displayed throughout the airport that definitely caught my eye.,After
158," At this point these airports are starting to kind of run together. I have been in and out of this airport a handful of times recently so wanted to throw down a few thoughts. The airport is located on the southeast side of Austin. Plenty of parking and easy to access. There is an on property Hilton Hotel if needed.The actual airport is what I would describe as ""fine"". It's not a hub so offerings will always be a bit more leaner when you are not catering to people on a layover. There are many restaurants though mainly the type you walk up and order, grab your food and sit. Some sit down full service options but very limited. The security line processes, etc are all pretty standard. It's not an overly large airport so not difficult to get around it. Plenty of bathrooms and I thought the airport was very clean. I have felt the wait for your luggage to be delivered has always been a bit long but all airports have little funky characteristics. At the end of the day the airport is fine but I really felt it was nondescript.",After
159," You could absolutely eat and shop yourself silly at this airport. I think it deserves a star alone since I was able to buy a bookmark here (if you know me, you know I collect them and they can be hard to find!) If you don't wanna brave the Salt Lick line in the city, fear not, there's one here. It's just annoying to get to the Uber/Lyft pickup area.",After
160," Yes, I know.....where's all the photos that I took to show how fancy this Austin - Bergstrom International airport is.  This will have to be a short one, because I will definitely update this review when we come back and redeem myself.  I'll be back!",After

162, I travel a lot so airports and airport food is something I'm used to. I am happy to say Austin has great food choices in their airport now. Love it all. Great local flair too. Keep it Weird Austin.,After
163, Great place to work.friendly people. Very easy to get around. Good food. Easy close parking. Very clean restrooms.,After

171," This airport's official ADA compliance policy appears to be ""disabled people can kiss our a$@!""Information desk made clear to me that there are no available options to have a cab meet you at the baggage claim.  No options.  At any price.The ONLY way to get a taxi or Uber is ""drag all your stuff half a mile across parking lots and busy streets to the official taxi zone.""If you are physically unable to actually accomplish this, the airports response is ""LOL, handi-boy.  Try not letting an IED blow your convoy up next time!""",After
172," If you're stuck here overnight it is unfortunate that none of the restaurants are open, there are only vending machines available. It would be nice to have at least one option to accommodate passengers who have a layover during the wee hours of the morning.",After
173," Very cool airport to go through.  Security has always been very fast getting me through.  Though I haven't driven to it myself, getting dropped off is usually fairly quick and easy (for an airport).The airport itself has a lot of food choices - most of them are local to Austin and have their own little shops (may I recommend Amy's Ice Cream or the Salt Lick if you have a lot of time to spare).There are also many different shops there to check out some local things - but also the typical kitschy shops with the super touristy wares.There's almost always live music going somewhere in the airport, which is a very nice and Austin-y touch.I've faced some delays here (I know it happens, so I'm not mad about it) but I never really mind because there is enough to see or eat to tide my over while I wait.",After

They are still under construction but clearly aren't thinking of the customers that have to use what is available.,After
176," Wonderful service, in and out.  Everyone at the airport was really nice from the time we checked in until the time we boarded our flight.  We decided to take our car and park it at the airport at first I was a bit hesitant to do so, but after arriving and seeing how easy the process was I extremely recommend it.  There are employees guiding you as to where to find a spot, once we park we immediately headed to the shuttle stop.  We might of waited 5 min for the shuttle, lady working on Sunday morning at 7:45 was extremely nice and helpful.  She handed us cards with the row and lane number.  Helped so much for once we got back in town.",After

178," I've always liked this airport. Small but not too small. Usually a breeze to get through security, at least compared to other airports. One long terminal so no annoying shuttles, and your gate is easy to find. Recently renovated and looks really nice. I also love the main bar with lice music. My only complaint is that they got rid of Schlotzskys :(",After
179," You can get through security fast, but after that ... no real food on the lower gate number side.  It's an airport... that's about it.Now this said they are doing a bunch of construction.  Until that's done ... get food ahead of time.",After
185," 2 stars because it's nicely decorated. It's the most visually pleasing airport I've been to so far. Too bad it has dumb employees. I know TSA is a pain in the ass no matter where you go, but here they made a fuss over me having BBQ sauce in my carry on. In Louisiana, I was able to go with my hot sauce bottle. Here they made me ""surrender"" my bbq sauce or check in my bag. No, I'm not paying a dumb amount to check in my harmless bag because of harmless bbq. It stayed with the idiot TSA agent. Whoever ends up keeping it, I hope they get diarrhea from it. Shit cost me money, it was a gift for a family member. That happened only to have the people at the gate check my bag in because the overhead bins in the plane were full by the time my zone was boarding. My bbq sauce was confiscated for no damn reason in the end. Worry about things that are a real threat, bbq sauce isn't going to cause absolute chaos on the damn plane. Ya'll so proud of your BBQ sauce that you don't want anyone taking some to their home state, tf. Also when I got on the plane, the overhead bins were not full at all, I saw some empty ones in fact. I don't get it, I don't understand the reasoning for not letting us bring on our carry ons. In fact, right now I saw them let one guy put his bag in one of the open overhead bins, he came in right after me ! Right after everyone else who was forced to check in their bag. I don't care if it was complimentary, it makes no sense to have done that when there is in fact room on the plane for our bags. I'm flying Delta and they're usually fantastic but it looks like at this particular airport, the stupid energy from inside spills into the plane. Pretty but stupid, best way to describe this airport.",After
186, Awesome airport! Security line was fast and efficient. Tons of food options for those of us wanting a quick meal and a lot of space to sit if you end up coming early for your flight. One of the cleaner airports I've been to as well.,After

Now were behind removed from the plane and forced to stand around causing us to miss an additional TWO flights. Every time I fly this airline there is always an issue and nothing you can do about it, because no matter what we still need to get to where we're going and the airline will still be up and running.

193," I think our little airport is growing into very cool international hub. The food represents Austin in a small snapshot kind of way. The parking is by far cheaper than the surrounding park n rides, and we've never had an issue with long term parking being too full. The upgrade to the cellphone lot was nicely done. The gas is stupid expensive, so that seems a bit like a rental car trap - I would never get gas at an airport anyway.",After
194," The Frontier Airlines terminal is the worst I've experienced. It's isolated from the rest of the airport and is small with only 3 gates, ALL outside. Amenities? A little store with a full bar and a taco truck outside next to the tarmac. Heard good things about Austin TX but after this experience, makes me never want to fly here again.",After
200," As an Employee the biggest hassle of the day is the employee parking lot. I have to leave my house an hour before I get to work to be in traffic for half an hour, then to get to the employee parking lot and drive around for a few minutes looking for parking only to find it in the middle of nowhere, then I have to walk to the first shuttle bus stop because if I go to any other bus stop then the small shuttle buses that come around every 10-15 minute will be full. Mostly all the first half of the parking lot is full so even if I wanted to walk in the scorching heat, it would still take me about 20 minutes or so to walk to the actual airport. Some of buses do not have working AC and they're super cramped and  get filled up quickly. There have been SEVERAL times in which I have waited either in the horrible heat or the pouring rain for theseSmall buses to come pick me up. Allllll of the construction workers take up the first half of the parking lot and I constantly have to drive around looking for parking spaces. Not to mention that there are vehicle that I see parked for weeks on end in the same spaces and that I have witnessed the construction workers littering in the parking lot. A suggestions?1. Possibly use bigger buses with working AC during the peak times when you know several employees will be coming in.2. A. Have the construction workers commute or give them stickers for their vehicles and make them park at the last parking space.     B. Give the construction workers a different parking space. Because I pay to park here and it's completely unreasonable to ask me to have to drive around so much annd wait so long for buses that don't even have working AC units that can inevitably cause heat exhaustion.Thanks.",After
201," The luster of anything Austin is gone, all the local restaurants and anything that made this place unique has been removed and replaced with expensive restaurant options, the Wi-Fi is horrible and there is no easy transportation like a cart to help you get from one location to the next in this ever growing airport.

Thousands of people it seems flying out and they can't get their s*** together. How disappointed I am in Austin.",After

203," Coolest US airport, the addition is really awesome! I hope the next time I'm Austin I depart on that end of the airport. It's so bright and well lit. The restrooms are amazing too. Live music keeps you entertained and gives AUS a unique touch and feel. TSA lines are manageable, TSA pre-check and CLEAR are both offered here. Free WiFi too.",After
204, The food options here are plentiful although currently they are renovating the side with gates 1-7 so you have to go towards the higher numbered gates to find anything good. I ate at a pizza place because I was all BBQED out but there are a few great BBQ options that I will try next time I'm in town.,After
205, Identifying the security checkpoints is surprisingly difficult at this airport. There are three of them spaced a ways apart and arranged in a way that makes ambulating between them -- and also through them -- a somewhat claustrophobic experience. Also the signage needs to improve to instill more confidence; am I at checkpoint three or checkpoint one? I have no way of knowing once I'm in line.Looks like the food options are good though.,After
206," Smaller airport, that is clean and efficient. Check in and TSA lines moved fast.  Baggage arrived in a timely manner. Car Rental is haul if you lots of bags. Getting in and out of the airport was easy, but lots of construction.  The only negative is the food prices, I have paid less at major airports in USA and Europe.",After
207, Such a nice airport! Very unique to the state. Looks like a ton of great restaurants to try and appears like it'd be very enjoyable as a layover location.,After
208," This is a fantastic regional airport!  Plenty of space, great food options, and diverse shops offering a little bit of everything ""Austin"" that you could ever want.  Since this is likely a ""destination"" airport rather than one where you'll be laying over while transferring from one flight to the next, they could get by with a lot less in the way of travel options but I think Austin has thought of their airport as part of the greater ""Austin Experience"" and it shows!I'm the type that always gets to the airport with plenty of time to spare and, between people watching, eating and shopping....the time flew by.  High ceilings (are you reading this Chicago O'Hare?) and wide walkways make it feel less crowded than most airports and bits of eclectic artwork here and there are fun to discover.While I don't think of any airport as a ""destination"" all by itself, this is one airport where I didn't mind spending an extra hour (or two) while waiting to catch my flight.",After
209," Currently under a lot of renovations, which is cool yet bothersome. Not sure if I like the new restroom signs, a lot of dudes seemed confused lol. I saw several men, including my husband nearly walk into the women's restroom. I do like all the artwork they have around, it's very cool.",After
210, Nice airport- they have a good commons area where they play live music and the gift shops have a good selection of souvenirs. I'd highly recommend the Salt Lick BBQ near Gate 21 if you want Texas style barbecue!,After
216," This airport itself is easy to get in  out.  The parking garage is another story . . .lol.  Not sure if it's always under construction or what the deal is.  Flew in  out 5 or 6 times and getting out to the highway was the hardest part.   This airport is clean and easy to get around  get luggage.  I've only met friendly people here, maybe that's Texas hospitality.",After
217," 2019 Update - 3.5 starsStill issues with ride share journey, but it looks like someone listened and they brought in some solid new food options. They also rolled out a full on Amy's ice cream which is fantastic. Pretty good dining options now but I hope they can add a couple fast food spots still. Also, while there's now a decent mix of places to eat, almost all of them are SO SLOW. You cannot get anything in under 10 minutes except Amy's and the convenience stores. I think it has something to do with the food service company they deploy, their workers are slow and lack any passion one would see at a real location of that restaurant. 2018 - 2 starsFor a city that has great food, this airport is a major joke. I fly out of here weekly and pull my hair each time I run late and don't get to eat elsewhere before arriving at the airport. They have all these wine stops and kitschy small places spots but no practical lunch or dinner food. Nothing fast. All disgusting places to eat. Will walk up and down the airport unimpressed. This is really frustrating. Also the shared ride pickup location and process here is unconscionable. Fix this airport and it's food dismal food options.",After

They have all these wine and beer stops and kitschy congested hipster hang out spots but no practical lunch or dinner food, and definitely no fast food spots. The food that is supposed to be uppity or quirky or whatever they're trying to go for tastes terrible. I wish I could just quickly order McDonald's or Chick Fil-A or something fast. You'll walk up and down the airport unimpressed and frustrated trying to find something to eat, unless you're a hipster who has 3 hours to sit around, drink beer, and waste time. Please fix this airport and it's dismal food options. Also please figure out a solution to your absurd shared ride pickup location and rental car facility location, and the general process of requesting a shared ride at AUS. It's literally over a 1/2 mile walk from baggage to get your ride or rental car.",After
219," I feel a little strange giving an airport four stars, but... the Austin airport is pretty great as far as airports go. Having said that, I've only made one trip in/out. But from what I experienced, I definitely wouldn't mind stopping here for a layover in the future. Layout seems pretty straight-forward, but the best part is the food. No major chains here, it all seems to be mini versions of local Austin restaurants. So cool! I will say, the prices are a bit steep. I'm pretty sure I paid $8 for a small bottle of water - but that's pretty much any airport for you. Also, to Danielle W. who writes ""it is TINY""and ""not a huge amount of food options""....ever been to Burbank?",After
220," AUS has one of the better food selections of any airports I've been in. It's a little strangely laid out, especially for getting out of it, but there's tons of local chains that have small restaurants in the airport, there are lots of good drinks, and things tend to be pretty on time.",After
221," ABIA is on the come up!!! Over the last year, they've spent a lot of time improving the environment and making it really say something about Austin. ALL of the restaurants, shops and stores are local and they're GOOD. No weird airport food gifts that you regret later. I actually enjoy coming to the airport now - I can sit and have a good glass of wine, a great plate or a shop while I wait for my flight.",After
222," No, no, no! This terminal is sooooo small. There are at least 300 people in this little area. One concession with a very long line to purchase a snack. We got here two hours before flight and there's nowhere to sit. Half of the people are just standing up and other are using the little floor space that's available including myself.",After
223," Austin's airport is Jekyll  Hyde.   Jekyll being the main terminal, and Hyde being the South terminal where Allegiant and Frontier fly out of.   The main terminal is modern, but the South terminal where the aforementioned fly into is miserable.  It will take you 10-15 minutes to make it back to the main terminal, with unreliable shuttle services.   We spent an hour waiting outside just to take the shuttle, then another :25 to get a rental car once we got to the main terminal.   Not ideals when you're adding another 1:45 to your trip after arrival.",After
224, It's an airport. It airports very well. But it is TINY. Like only 30 gates tiny. I will say the security line moves relatively quickly considering the size. Not a huge amount of food options but they have built up the cell phone lot so there is gas and food there too. Not bad but not great. Incredibly middle of the road airport wise. Be so careful as the cops are ALWAYS there trying to speed trap you.,After
225, Don't land at the south terminal. Waiting an hour for a shuttle to main terminal and rental cars,After
226," This review is only for all the Food Stores and Bars inside the Airport, in which the Airport Management allowed to operate. They're all serving pricey foods, drinks and other merchandise, coded $$ price mostly.All foodie stores serving Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) are locally owned Austin, TX food businesses. So as fashion stores and bars. Austin Airport management should have fast food chains (Wendy's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, Whataburgerthat caters to other international passengers, not only for local Austin residents/passengers. Trying to be unique? If so, food, drinks and dry goods merchandise being sold should be at reasonable prices.",After
232," Flying out of the main airport at ABIA has always been convenient. They have upgraded their art, have plenty of places to plug in and relax, Tables not attached to specific restaurants where you can sit and eat. The food selection is top notch with a good portion of the restaurants in a convenient ""food court"" setting. There's some more upscale ones sprinkled throughout. Easy place to kill time between layovers with some shopping. The updated restrooms are beautiful with the art right in the entrance of each one. Pick ups are a bit trickier. If you have someone picking you up you need to time it just right or your driver is going to get yelled at for parking. The last time I was picked up my sister had to circle the airport six times until finally just driving out of ABIA and parking at the Starbucks down the road until I had grabbed my luggage. I saw signs for designated uber/lyft/taxi pickups.",After
233," A great small airport, with ample seating and food options. Albeit it is under construction at the moment but only to allow for more terminals and food options. Long term parking is cheap and usually open. Security is pretty quick 20 minutes tops. Getting an Uber or lyft can be rough as you have to walk a decent ways from the terminal.",After
234," What's with the punishment gauntlet for rideshare (Lyft/Uber/Ride Austin) and taxi riders? Seriously effed up! It's way too hot in Austin to drag people through that, with no warning and very little signage. Is an air conditioned smooth floor tunnel on the way?? If not, and I doubt there is, this airport needs to come up with a closer pickup area quick (at least in the first garage).It's truly shocking that this awesome airport hands people their asses like this - as if to say, welcome to the best and worst of Austin, suckers!We got back late last night with our newborn baby, exhausted. Look up a Lyft, go outside, and there are no clearly marked signs. Asked an employee if there's a particular area to go. She says it's quite a walk. Go to the first garage, up the elevator, walk across that garage, into another garage, and wait there for a car.Had I ordered a car then, it would've left by the time we got to it. We lug all our junk, (thank god we got a cart) and our baby through the first garage. Every seamed ridge on the pavement, we have to stop and lift the cart over each hump. People without carts behind us are lined up and pissed. Baby's crying. We're all sweating our brains out, and it's only 11 pm. Imagine if it had been 95 degrees or hotter in the day! What happens when a human in a wheelchair passes? Does someone have to lift them up over each ridge as well? That's insane!Why are they torturing people for catching a rideshare or taxi? What about babies, old people, and folks with physical disabilities just trying to catch a ride? That's some poor planning. And heartless, too!Just fix it. And riders, you have been warned. Prepare to be amazed by how shockingly crappy it is!",After
235, Be prepared to walk and walk and walk.  With construction and the fact they close access points after 6pm it means you can have to go from one end to the other.  The taxi stand/ride share feels like it is in another zip code and really a pain in the ass to get to.  Thank goodness I travel alone - with kids that schlep would be terrible.   One hidden ATM (they swear there are two but one is always out of cash).  The plus is great food joints!   I am a 2 million miler so I live in airports - if it was not for the food and great staff they would get 1 star for how poorly planned/laid out it is.,After
236," This is a really nice airport!  I travel a lot and this is one of the most comfortable airports I've seen in the US.AUS offers a lot of different seating options - not just in dining areas, but at boarding gates.  It's something you rarely see...  tables and chairs - at a gate!  Also comfortable individual lounge chairs.  And my favorite - plenty of work desks and computer stations.    Ample outlets and charging stations.  They've truly made this a great place to get some work done.I also loved the interesting food and vending options...  lots of local restaurants instead of the usual chains.  And a Benefit vending machine in case you forgot to pack mascara.  No one really wants to hang out at an airport...  but if I had to, I wanna be stuck at AUS!",After
237," This is by far one of if not my favorite airport.  Maybe I am a homer, but in reality I probably spend less time there than any other airport so not sure if that is the case.It is always clean, the WiFi is easy and fast and they have been working hard the last few years expanding and improving.  Now for some the last bit would be a negative and I would agree the construction can be loud, irritating, and lack of options because of the renovation can be a pain.  However it has been fairly minimal in my experience and I think it is worth the wait.  Pro tips1. New parking garage is awesome2. Peach Tortilla is a must3. Waterloo records for your swag4. That Maya for your coffee 5. Know your terminals!! South Terminal is easy at least another 15 minutes.  Spirit, Frontier and other second tier I mean how many airports have this much live music and interesting art? Get there early and hang for a while.  Use one of the newer gates to get through quickly , as I rarely have an issue with security wait times.Just another gem in our city.  Love the fact this is how we say howdy and see ya in the capital of our great state! Good work ABIA!",After
238," What I love most about ABIA is that it's full of the city's vibrant culture. A bunch of new local food options, it's clean and modern. Always have had a pleasant experience from going through TSA lines through to checking out one of the places to grab food/drinks before getting on flights. They also have live music and bbq places on the terminal which is great.They've also changed the Uber/lyft pickups to the ground floor of the parking garage so that might be a bit confusing for returning visitors. Safe at all times of the hour and you get to enjoy what Austin has to offer! Overall a great spot!The airport is modern, clean and the staff is friendly! Plus its situated at a perfect place in Austin. It is fairly close to downtown Austin!",After
239," Hands down best airport in the world!!!! It's so Austin. First of all, I love the Austin airport because it's so close to the city. I leave my house and am at the airport and through security in ~30 mins. Coming from traveling mostly through Houston and Atlanta (which granted are obviously much much larger hubs, but still), this is huge. All of the restaurants at the Austin airport are local restaurants, which is awesome and also very keeping with Austin character. Not to mention, all of the food is actually GOOD. There's no wendy's, McDonald's, etc... literally none of that, there's only bomb Austin restaurants. There's live music at the Delaware North place, and it rings throughout the whole terminal. I feel like such a weirdo for raving about an airport this much, but seriously, it's the best!!!!! Also you rarely have to wait that long for security. This airport is one of a kind.",After
240," I have not traveled much but every time I've had I have had zero issues coming through this airport.   Their food options are pretty good with tacodeli and BBQ options but of course the prices are jacked up. Restrooms we clean enough and the terminals were clean too. Overall, just a short pass through and good to go.",After
241, It's a great airport I'm giving it 5 stars only because they are doing so much expansion and building once I get everything done it's going to be that much better,After
247," When it comes to airports , this is one of my favorites . I could take pictures of the creative food options or posh lounges but that's fluff. The best aspect: CLEAR PICKUP DIRECTIONS FOR UBER AND LYFT. This is the southern hospitality makes it a great airport",After
248, Leaving Austin is so hard but this airport is so fun!!! All the restaurants and bars are to die for. It's like a little bar crawl before your flight. They also have play areas for kids as well. Keeping Austin diverse,After
249," It's SUPER tough for just about any domestic airport to compete with my beloved PDX (Portland) but Austin did a DAMN good job of impressing this Portlandian!  My mom lives in Tennessee so she and I met in Austin for Mother's Day weekend and had such a great time! The terminals are easily walkable, there are tons of food and drink options, and the live music fits Austin perfectly.  Minus one star because, like almost every other airport (EXCEPT PDX!!), the prices are marked up simply because you're in an airport.  That's one of the things I love about PDX - STREET PRICING on all purchases!  The other reason is the ride share pickup location is a loooooong walk through parking garages and what not.  It would be great to walk outside from baggage claim and be picked up curbside.  But still, AUS is a great airport and I'd happily fly in and out of it depending on the trip!",After
250," Easy to navigate, plenty of food and shopping stores if you need to pass some time. Very clean considering the volume of passengers moving thru. TSA was quick and easy, plenty of folks to guide you thru and answer questions. Plenty of clean rest rooms, the car rental situation was well marked. Great signage- easy to find a rental (on site, no need for shuttle). Expansion is underway but you won't even notice.",After
251, Review of ABIA's arrival transportation option. Flat out they failed all their arriving customers when they decided to put the taxi/ride share providers so far away across a giant concrete parking lot that has no internet reception (ATT). You have been warned - either drive and park at the airport or get a family/friend to pick you up. Otherwise be prepared to sweat your ass off walking across the garage in TX heat to get to the taxi area and then not be able to use your phone so you'll be stuck with the traditional taxi services.,After
252," I would give it one star but the terminal has outstanding eats. I'm from Austin and recently experienced how incompetent the TSA staff really is. Was in the line for Checkpoint 3 and a staff member announce to the line that Checkpoint 2 was looking for people to check and it's a much faster line. So about 12 of us went over there, giving up our place in line at CP 3(checkpoint 3). When we all arrived at CP 2, they told us it was only for certain members and to go to CP 1. Went over there and that line is even longer than the line we left at CP 3! Went back to CP 2 and asked to be let in to the line for CP 2 and they refused even after I pleaded my case and told them what happened. The response when I told the woman I lost my place in line because someone said that CP 2 was open and all she said was ,""I gotta deal with that everyday."" She told me to go to CP 1. Well CP 1 had a much longer wait time than CP 3 as clearly displayed on the large screen in front of her(there are screens that will tell you the approx wait time per checkpoint). So instead of helping me out juuuust a bit and suggesting I go to CP 3 due to the shorter wait time, she just went into autopilot and told me to do the worst possible choice in that situation. So I wasted 11 minutes of my life and lost my place in line. I returned to CP 3 and saw the guy who asked for volunteers to switch lines initially and told him to stop sending people over there. He just replied ,""I just do what I'm told."" Wow. I can't stand TSA. They hire people who don't have to think about what they are doing and just go thru the motions. This is supposed to make me feel safer when TSA employs people who don't care about anything but clocking out and clearly hate their jobs. It would have been a simple gesture for someone to say they were sorry and maybe attempt to expedite the security process for the people who got out of line. I don't expect 5 star customer service from airport staff but good god what a sh*t show. Point is....don't go to checkpoint 2 if it's offered to you!!!! It's a scam! Maybe that's why they want you there two hours early. Because the incompetent staff will at some point f*ck up and slow you down. TSA is a joke and some moron wearing a cheap uniform and blue gloves doesn't make me or anyone else feel safer. In fact, when you hire people who don't give a sh*t, it is counterproductive to the desired goal.",After
253, I  love this airport!! I came in from DFW. It was so easy to find the restrooms!! Easy to get in and out of !! The terminals are easy to get to. Restrooms were clean!!,After
254," ABIA pales in comparison to some of the other international and domestic airports in the US and abroad but still fills me with hometown pride anytime I'm here. The airport is easy to navigate, even as it grows to accommodate our bustling city, has plenty of Texas staples (Rudy's BBQ, Amy's Ice Cream, etc) and even a dash of southern hospitality.",After
255," I was torn between a 3 or 4 star rating. But I chose four simply for the fact that it is very easy to navigate where you are and where you need to be, unlike some airports *cough* JFK *cough* where it feels like you are in maze with no way to get help. I had to take away one star  because, I'm sure as anyone knows who's been in Austin for more than 30 seconds. It's vegan vegan vegan. And same thing with the airport. That have taken so many great food places and replaced with some vegan/vegetarian place. And if you are wanting a nice non vegan meal, it'll cost you your left kidney. But as long as you come with food or eat good before coming, then you should be fine. Now onto security. It's not too too bad but it still isn't fun. Try to show up at least 2 hours early to get yourself situated. And last but not least by far, the damn currency exchange place that's right outside of security, they are THE BIGGEST scammers you will ever meet. I gave them 1000$ and purchased rubles. Only for him to hand me 750$ worth of rubles. Do not use them unless you absolutely need too. Most countries accept the big card companies such as master/visa etc. Hopefully this helps you figure out Austin airport a bit better and I hope you have a nice trip:)",After
256," It's hard to like an airport, but there's a lot to like about ATX.I've been to airports around the world, and they all have something different to offer.  I like ATX because it's a small airport (comparatively to other big city airports) and feels new inside.Going through airport security was quick and painless.  Once you're through you really just want to find a comfortable place to sit and maybe get some food.  There's a bunch of decent food options throughout the terminal.  There's also different seating options spread throughout....if you have time to kill and don't need to be sitting right in front of your gate.My favorite part of ATX was when I discovered they have bathrooms for dogs.  I have dogs but try not to travel with any of them because it's so difficult and inconvenient.  Even if you have a well behaved dog, they still need to go potty.I saw this sign for doggy restrooms and thought I would check it out....see attached pictures.  Really cool.  At least if I'm traveling to or from ATX I know it's a little easier to have a dog with me.Thanks ATX.",After
262," This is one of the cutest airports! They have great food options, clean bathrooms, convenient shopping and even live music. Sitting having a coffee near your gate and listening to a local band is a great way to end a hard working day in Austin!",After
263," Needs a Whataburger. And a Torchy's.  Don't @ me.Clean bathrooms, weird set up. Nice to walk up and down the concourse if you've got time to burn. International flight area is interesting to say the least.",After
264," I am sure this is a great airport if you are not stuck in South Terminal. This is a horrible set-up with only one small snack bar and over priced drinks. There is no connection to the main terminal which means when your flight is 3 hours delayed you get to sit in uncomfortable chairs touching elbows with strangers.Do not ever fly Frontier, Allegiant,  VIA to Austin, Texas.",After
265," Despite road construction, well designed, easy in and out. Clean friendly environment, truly a great airport experience",After
266, It's ok. They really don't need people playing music to keep the country music vibe of Texas alive. It's an airport. Eat before maybe. Just like... we get it it's Texas.,After
267," Great airport.  Several shops and eateries with pretty good options.  Security was fairly quick and the overall airport is pretty easy to navigate.  I do wish it was a little bit on the wider side since there are several parts of the airport and seem to be a little too narrow and feel a little squished.  Overall, good though.",After
268, Horrible little airport on the departure side. Internet service is buggy and v-e-r-y      s-lo-w. TSA lines are confused and contradictory.  PA announcements overlap.  And don't get me started on the massive Construction Zone all around the airport.,After
269, Easy in and out airport with great selection of food and just very easy to get around I'm a fan of this airport,After
270," bit  different than the last time i flew out of  there , this  was a international flight  to london    going though security the officer questioned what was in my carry on bag   finally got to pick out a tube of  toothpaste  it was to large  he said we only allow tubes 3/4 inch long  so i had to surrender it   he said i could have had 2 or nore smaller sizes but not one large one  ??  still trying to fiqure that out ..",After
271," Got a straight throu flight from here to ronald  reagan national airport dc  on southwest ( my airline of choice ) pretty  nice and clean airport , well laid out and not all that large . interesting feature of this airport it has a cell phone waiting  area (free of charge ) for  those planning  to pick up passengers, when the flight is in you are informed and you just drive on over to the terminal  saves a lot of frustration  and bunching on kerb side   .For those  traveling .parking is  $7 dollars a day  ** note ** parts of a 24 hour period are counted as a full day  so if   like us you were there for  4 days and  5  hours  it costs $ 35 .  shuttle bus to the terminal waited for us to park which was very considerate , althou  it  was a busy day the line  thou security didnt take more than about  15 mins they had at least 4 bays open.  coming back was the same story,  quick exit to the shuttle bus stop, we did not  have any  checked baggage and we were on the way home within half hour of landing  pretty good experiance both times  ,",After
272," I love this airport! Small, cute, and gets the job done. It's easy to navigate, and I love how they've infused Austin all over it, from Salt Lick to Amy's Ice Cream. All of the artwork around the airport adds to the Austin vibe as well.",After
278," I was only in the Austin airport briefly, but I am sure I will be back soon enough. Man oh man is this a cool airport. When I arrived in Austin and walked out of the terminal, I heard the sound of live music and followed it. I found this adorable little courtyard in the airport with a stage, a musician playing some tunes, a Moscow mule bar, restaurants that resembled food trucks and an area of stadium style seating and some picnic tables. It was so cool! I felt like I knew what Austin, TX was about before I even got out of the airport. The city didn't disappoint either. I can't wait to come back and hope to have more time to explore the airport next time!",After
279," The airport security here is extremely fast and efficient from my few experiences. They have a sign out front of the security check point with an estimated wait time like you'd see at Disneyland. My wait time here read 3-7 minutes and I found that to be accurate. They have a lot of restaurants and gift shops inside that'll keep you occupied for those longer layovers. Their food and alcohol selection is better than most airports. The airport is clean and modern. I saw ready-made sandwich stands, a tacos spot, a place that sold makeup and ornaments (though the ornaments were a whopping $44!) and a clothing shop that also sold backpacks. Getting an Uber here or ride share is a little different from other airports because the lot is far. You have to go out into the parking lot into the second floor and look for the correct colored column that corresponds with the Uber or Lyft you requested. The location is pretty far so you'll need to be prepared to walk. Do not call the Uber ahead of time while you're still in the terminal. Be sure to call it when you're at the actual pick-up location.",After
280," I'm a fan! We flew to the Austin airport from LAX and were impressed by how clean this airport was. This airport is obviously on the smaller side but very organized! We also really enjoyed the convenience of the airport. The Uber/Lyft pick up section at the parking garage was such a good idea! Basically there are different colored poles and numbers and you can select the corresponding one on your app. It made our rideshare pickup after our flight absolutely painless.We didn't eat at the Austin airport, but the food looked better than at most airports! I definitely would have gotten Salt Lick BBQ if I had been hungry, and maybe some dessert at Amy's Ice Cream after!",After
281, So I'd like to know what genius put the cell based car service pickup in the bottom of a parking garage where I had no cell coverage. Not to mention the hike to get there. Very frustrating.,After
282, I love to coming Austin for work and fun! The airport is very clean even during construction. The staff is always friendly and willing to help. The food offerings are diverse and a little different just like Austin. While they don't have Starbucks they do have this super cool coffee robot. Not a bad cup of coffee either. Check it out next time you are in the terminal waiting for your flight... it's between gate 18 an,After

284," I just had to be shuffled from the pick up area to the ""red zone"" in order to catch my Uber ride. WHY??? What a bunch of poppycock. I paid for my airfare just like everyone else. Why are we being punished? Whoever made this decision, you can stick it where the sun don't shine you bunch of heartless psychopaths. It's 0100  I'm exhausted. I have plenty of other flowery adjectives  nouns but I'd like for people to actually see my review. However, I'm going to perfectly clear that I'm super passed that ABIA is doing this. Boooooo!!",After
285," ABIA is such a cute little airport. So easy to navigate, quick check-in and security pass. A superior selection of local eateries to choose from. They have an AA Admiral's Club, which is always nice. Why only 3 stars then? 1.) I'm used to departing from a home port that has direct flights with no layovers (thanks mostly to SWA this is getting better at ABIA). 2.) Everything closes so early (even the AA Club). What is up with that? 3.) And, having traveled through many airports, WHY does it take SO LONG to retrieve checked baggage at ABIA (knocks down from a 4 to a 3 star review)? I've grabbed my bags faster at ATL, and that says a lot.I love ya ABIA, but sometimes I just don't like ya.",After
286," The worst updated airport in the US prior to getting past TSA. Narrow, poorly marked roads, slippery surfaces, check in gates have no flow design with people bumping into each other, TSA personnel yelling at everyone increasing the stress of flying and the list goes on.  Past TSA the food courts offer a good variety with cool design work.  However, select locations are blasting a variety of music while airlines are making announcements over the PA system, thus increasing the stress of flying once again.  If your renting a car and are filling up at the airport, pre-plan the route to the Texaco station at the airport.  Their are no obvious signs leading you to the roadway and getting back on the path will cost you up to 20 minutes while circling back.  Pay attention to the one cluttered sign pointing to the gas station.  Austin is well known for constant road construction and tight on/off ramps, but it gets much worse at the airport.  Get it together Austin!!   Not good when much larger airports offer easier  safer access.",After
287," This is a review for the TSA precheck people.Your appointment means nothing to them. They run behind? You get boned. I tried to do this in a lunch break but it takes almost a full hour just to drive round trip let alone park and get out of parking.If you guys won't honor appointments on the dot, get more people to do it. You can't just make appointments then throw people in front. Let the walk ins deal with it?",After
288, One of the better airports ive been to. Easy to return the rental car here. Bathrooms are nice towards gates 1-10. Tons of food options. The delta gates have good seating with a good amount of charging outlets.,After
294, Apparently the airport is going though a facelift as a result virtually all the food options are closed. Huge disappointment as I like to bring a meal onto my flight. Eat before you come to the airport!,After
295," ABIA is one of my favorite airports to fly in and out of, despite it not being a hub. Here's why:1. The airport is on the smaller side and the layout is very organized, with clear signage everywhere, and you can walk between any two points in the airport in under ten minutes.2. Water fountains and bathrooms at regular intervals.3. You're spoilt for choice with all the food options here- from the Peached Tortilla (Asian-Mexican style street food), Salt Lick (Breakfast! Tacos!), Berry Austin (froyo), and Amy's Ice Cream. There are a few high quality wine and cocktail bars, so it's a great airport to be stranded at, if it comes to that. Even the convenience/book stores inside have a distinct Austin flair, and are great options for picking up last minute souvenirs.4. The Rideshare and Taxi pickup points are outside the airport, in a parking garage structure, so even though it's a bit of a walk to get an Uber, it's much less of a clusterfuck.5. Live music in some public areas and the aforementioned wine/cocktail bars.Taking off one star because there aren't a lot of charging ports or electrical points, so charging your phone is a bit of struggle during peak hours.",After
296," If you like frou frou your in luck. The restaurants are all terrible and overpriced, but I get it keep Austin weird! Juice bars and every made up allergy friendly option your heart desires. It is clean but that's about all it's got going for it. It's not the Austin airport it use to be.",After
297," Signage sucks, traffic to and from the airport sucks, all the food options are local with no major restaurant choices.... I'm in Texas, can't get a Whataburger in the airport with normal prices??? Nobody from out of town cares that everything is local.... Who puts live music in an airport??? Is it really that important??? Saw someone playing the guitar to nobody in a corner just because the airport has to have live music. During a certain time, you can't hear announcements and it's just a cluster F**k when planes are delayed and everyone is getting drunk... If Austin wants to be top notch, this is not not a top notch airport.",After
298, Avoid security checkpoint 1!  Very slow and unorganized. They are constantly broadcasting found (left behind) property.They made me toss two containers that were allow in Atlanta.,After
299," Very clean airport! Easy to navigate and lines went by smoothly. The parking was incredibly easy. Came in around 4am for a 6am flight and there were multiple people directing you where to go. Since I was parking for 5 days I chose the ""long term parking"" with the economy price $8 per day. As soon as I parked multiple buses came up to pick us up and take us to the terminal. Would highly recommend this parking service. Make sure to call the day before because they do get full pretty easily.",After
300," Nice variety of restaurants, bars, and shops. Parking is usually pretty easy and I've only run into long lines once.",After
301," As a frequent flyer, I'm so happy to have ABIA as my home airport. It's convenient and well laid out. Many non-stop flights and a variety of airlines. Security is literally the best in the nation - friendly and faster than most airports. Plenty of good local restaurants once you get past security that are not exorbitantly priced. Live music regularly. Flying will always be a pain, but ABIA takes a little of the sting away.",After
302," I flew out of Austin this morning (Saturday), and had a wonderful experience! My flight departed at 8:45, and I arrived at 7:30. I used the economy parking, which is $8 a day; they have traffic directors to help you figure out where to park too. A shuttle took me from the parking lot to the terminal in no time. When I arrived at​ the security checkpoint, the estimated wait was 7-11 minutes, but they split the line and directed me to go begin another checkpoint, so I ended up being one of the first ones in line. The TSA agents were extremely friendly here, something I've​ never experienced! The line moved quickly and I soon made my way to my gate, with about 20 minutes to spare before boarding. I flew American Airlines to LAX and we left right on time. I fly out of DFW frequently, so I am accustomed to long security lines and a large airport to navigate. This airport is much smaller with signs to help direct you to your destination. They have a variety of unique restaurants/bars to buy tacos, salads, bagels, wine, souvenirs, and snacks for the flight! Austin is definitely the place to be if you get stressed easily with buys airports- everyone is so helpful!",After
303," Used to be 5 stars, then the congestion and ""hipification"" has made it a far less pleasurable experience. What on earth were they thinking moving the taxi/rideshare to a ridiculously convoluted and difficult location? This in no way alleviates the congested pickup lines. The backup for pickups (and dropoffs) is caused by the unending stream of pedestrians crossing the pickup lanes, causing cars to wait. The solution to this is simple ( not to the ABIA planners, apparently): have crossing guards hold up foot traffic until there is a critical mass of pedestrians and not a constant stream of 1 or 2 people crossing, thus allowing cars to cycle through. They already have guards in place to shoo away waiting cars, who have little to do most of the time. Finally, the long-awaited terminal extension is now open and is terrible. On the left side the Delta waiting areas are cramped and insufficient. I don't know who designed this, but I would fire them immediately. Also, the  art/advertising monoliths in the middle of the corridor impede traffic and contribute to the crowded sense and difficulty of passage. And while I'm at it, has anyone at ABIA heard about moving sidewalks? It's a new invention currently in use at every other airport!",After
309, The airport is small for the city. If you don't have TSA plan to be in security for awhile. The airport seems to be busy at all times. I fly a lot on different days and different times of the day and never fails for it to be busy. Bathrooms are clean. There isn't a Starbucks which sucks and the restaurants aren't the typical that you see large cities. Frontier is at a different location. It is a very small place with one concession that is way over priced! I suggested paying a little more for a better airline.,After
310," As the live music capital of the world, it's not all that surprising to hear live music when you land here. No shortage of shops and places to eat. Has a united lounge which is great.",After
311, No moving sidewalks inside the airport...no train inside the airport! You have to walk a half a mile to get to your Uber pick up or a taxi - very small town antiquated system,After
312," Excellent Airport in terms of ease of use, friendliness of staff, ease of passage through TSA security, and food choices.  Many local and regional restaurants represented here. Car rental is a slight hike which could be a challenge in mid'summer. Tickets seemed reasonably priced.",After
313, Had no problems flying in or out of ATX. My afternoon flight out was cancelled the morning of and I panicked for no reason. I arrived with no need to rush or stress.,After
314," I have to leave one star just so people will actually read this.  If you are a pet owner this is highly important.  There is no pet relief station in the airport.  The pet relief is in the parking garage.  Wow! This is so wrong.  Have they never heard of rental cars, taxis, my mom's dropping me off and so on.  We had a rental car so we never made it to the parking garage.  Lucky for me, I have a puppy that is pad trained.  I had pads with me.  The challenge was getting him not to run off while I put him down in the ladies room.  Thankfully all the ladies thought he was cute.  I can only imagine the dirty looks I could have gotten because I'm letting my pet pee or poop on the restroom.  That was my only option.  Bad move for the airport.  Be prepared.",After

316, Super disappointing airport. The rental car center is a disaster run by sub-humans. Then there's a mile-long walk from the rental car center to the terminal; they need a moving walkway at the very least. They get 2 stars from me for having a Salt Lick and an Amy's. The TSA assholes took my Central Market salsa. God forbid I take a cup of salsa onto the airplane. FUCK YOU BERGSTROM TSA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,After
317, The airport is small. The food options are really limited but parking is plenty and public transportation was easy. The people who work in TSA weren't very accommodating but that's usually a hit or miss. Others were helpful and the other passengers seemed very nice.,After
